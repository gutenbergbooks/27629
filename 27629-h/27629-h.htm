<h3>AUTHOR'S NOTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> revising and partially rewriting my novel, 'Captain
Desmond, V.C.,' I have been glad to make good the
opportunity afforded me of bringing the Aftermath nearer to
my original conception than it was in its first form. The
three short chapters now substituted for the one final scene
are therefore, in essence, no innovation. They represent
more or less what I conceived at the time, but suppressed
through fear of making my book too long; and thereby risked
upsetting the balance of sympathy, which I hope the fresh
chapters may tend to restore.</p>

<h4>JUDGE FOR YOURSELF.</h4>

<p class="center">"Do we move ourselves, or are moved by an Unseen Hand at
a game?"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tennyson.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honor Meredith</span> folded her arms upon the window-ledge of the
carriage and looked out into the night: a night of strange,
unearthly beauty.</p>

<p>The full moon hung low in the west like a lamp. A chequered
mantle of light and shadow lay over the mountain-barrier of
India's north-western frontier, and over the desolate levels
through which the train, with its solitary English
passenger, sauntered at the rate of seven miles an hour.
Even this degree of speed was clearly something of an
achievement, attainable only by incessant halting to take
breath&mdash;for ten or fifteen minutes&mdash;at embryo stations: a
platform, a shelter, and a few unhappy-looking out-buildings
set down in a land of death and silence&mdash;a profitless
desert, hard as the nether millstone and unfruitful as the
grave.</p>

<p>During these pauses the fret and jar of the labouring train
gave place to a babel of voices&mdash;shouting, expostulating,
denunciating in every conceivable key. For the third-class
passenger in the East is nothing if not vociferous, and the
itch of travel has penetrated even to these outskirts of
empire.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<p>Sleep, except in broken snatches, was a blessing past
praying for, and as the moon swung downward to the hills,
Honor Meredith had settled herself at the open window, to
watch the lifeless wastes glide silently past, and await the
coming of dawn.</p>

<p>She had been journeying thus, with only moon and stars, and
unfamiliar scenes of earth for company, since eight o'clock;
and morning was near at hand. The informal civilisation of
Rawal Pindi lay fifty miles behind her; and five miles ahead
lay Kushalghur, a handful of buildings on the south bank of
the Indus, where the narrow line of railway came abruptly to
an end. Beyond the Indus a lone wide cart-road stretched,
through thirty miles of boulder-strewn desert, to the little
frontier station of Kohat.</p>

<p>For six years it had been Honor's dream to cross the Indus
and join her favourite brother, the second-in-command of a
Punjab cavalry regiment; to come into touch with an India
other than the light-hearted India of luxury and smooth
sailing, which she had enjoyed as only daughter of General
Sir John Meredith, K.C.B., and now, with the completion of
her father's term of service, her dream had become an almost
incredible reality.</p>

<p>It was not without secret qualms of heart and conscience
that the General had yielded to her wish. For frontier life
in those earlier times still preserved its distinctive
flavour of isolation and hazard, which has been the making
of its men, and the making or marring of its women; and
which the northward trend of the "fire-carriage" has almost
converted into a thing of the past. But sympathy with her
mettlesome spirit, which was of his own bestowing, had
outweighed Sir John's anxiety. On the eve of sailing he had
despatched her with his blessing and, by way of practical
accessory, a handsome revolver, which he had taught her to
use as accurately as a man.</p>

<p>And now, while she sat alone in the mellow moonlight of
early morning, within a few miles of the greatest river of
the Punjab, not even the pain of recent parting could lessen
the thrill of independence and adventure, that quickened her
pulses, and stirred the deep waters of her soul.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>
<p>At five-and-twenty this girl still remained heart-whole, as
at nineteen: still looked confidently forward to the best
that life has to give. For, despite a strong practical
strain in her nature, she was an idealist at the core. She
could not understand that temper of mind which sets out to
buy a gold watch, and declines upon a silver one because the
other is not instantly attainable. She would have the best
or none: and, with the enviable assurance of youth, she
never doubted but that the best would be forthcoming in good
time.</p>

<p>For this cause, no doubt, she had failed to make the
brilliant match tacitly expected of her by a large circle of
friends ever since her arrival in the country. None the
less, she had gone cheerfully on her way, untrammelled by
criticism, quite unaware of failure, and eternally
interested in the manifold drama of Indian and Anglo-Indian
life. Her father and four soldier brothers had set her
standard of manhood, and had set it high; and although in
the past eight years many men had been passionately
convinced of their ability to satisfy her needs of heart and
brain, not one among them had succeeded in convincing Sir
John Meredith's clear-sighted daughter.</p>

<p>But thought of all these things was far from her as she
watched the moon dip to the jagged peaks that shouldered the
stars along the western horizon. The present held her; the
future beckoned with an encouraging finger; and she had no
quarrel with the past.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>
<p>By now the moon's last rim formed a golden sickle behind a
blunt shoulder of rock; while over the eastward levels the
topaz-yellow of an Indian dawn rushed at one stride to the
zenith of heaven. In the clear light the girl's beauty took
on a new distinctness, a new living charm. The
upward-sweeping mass of her hair showed the softness of
bronze, save where the sun burnished it to copper. Breadth
of brow, and the strong moulding of her nose and chin,
suggested powers rather befitting a man than a woman. But in
the eyes and lips the woman triumphed&mdash;eyes blue-grey under
very straight brows, and lips that even in repose preserved
a rebellious tendency to lift at the corners. From her
father, and a long line of fighting ancestors, Honor had
gotten the large build of a large nature; the notable lift
of her head; and the hot blood, coupled with endurance, that
stamps the race current coin across the world.</p>

<p>A jolt of unusual violence, flinging her against the
carriage door, announced conclusively her arrival at the
last of the embryo stations, and straightway the stillness
of dawn was affronted by a riot of life and sound. Men,
women, and children, cooking-pots and bundles, overflowed on
to the sunlit platform; and through their midst, with a
dignified aloofness that only flowers to perfection in the
East, Honor Meredith's tall <i>chuprassee</i>
<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
made his way to her carriage window. Beside him, in a scarlet coat
over full white skirts, cowered the distressed figure of an old ayah,
who for twenty years had been a pillar of the household of Meredith.</p>

<p>"Hai, hai, Miss Sahib!" she broke out, lifting wrinkled
hands in protest. "How was it possible to sleep in such a
night of strange noises, and of many devils let loose; the
rail <i>gharri</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
itself being the worst devil of them all! Behold, your Honour hath
brought us to an evil country, without water and without food. A
country of murderers and barefaced women. Not once, since the leaving
of Pindi, have I dared close an eyelid lest some unknown evil befall
me."</p>

<p>A statement which set her companion smiling under the
shelter of his moustache and beard, at thought of the many
times he had saved her slumbering form from collision
against the woodwork of the train. But, with the courtesy of
his kind, he forebore to discomfort her by mention of such
trifling details.</p>

<p>"It is necessary to cross the river on foot, Miss Sahib," he
said: and without more ado Honor fared forth into the
untempered sunlight, closely followed by her two attendants,
and a string of half-naked coolies bearing her luggage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<p>From the dreary little terminus a cart-track sloped to the
river, which at this point sweeps southward with a strong
rush of water, its steep banks forming a plateau on either
hand. The narrow gorge was spanned by a rough bridge of
boats lashed firmly together; and on the farther side Honor
found a lone dak bungalow, its homely dovecot and wheeling
pigeons striking a friendly note amid the callousness of the
surrounding country.</p>

<p>An armed orderly, who had been taking his ease in the
verandah, sprang smartly to his feet and saluted; and behind
him, on the threshold, a red-bearded khansamah, who might
have walked straight out of an Old Testament picture-book,
proffered obsequious welcome to the <i>Major Sahib's Miss</i>.
Honor bestowed a glance of approval upon her new protector,
whose natural endowments were enhanced by the picturesque
uniform of the Punjab Cavalry. A khaki tunic, reaching
almost to his knees, was relieved by heavy steel
shoulder-chains and a broad kummerband of red and blue.
These colours were repeated in the peaked cap and voluminous
turban, while over the kummerband was buckled the severe
leathern sword-belt of the West.</p>

<p>The man held out a letter; and Honor, summarily dismissing
the khansamah,&mdash;who thrust himself upon her notice with the
insistent meekness of his kind,&mdash;passed on into the one
sitting-room, with its bare table and half-dozen dilapidated
chairs. Balancing herself on the former, she broke the seal
with impatient fingers, for the sight of her brother's
handwriting gladdened her like a hand-clasp across thirty
miles of space.</p>

<p>Then she started, and all the light went out of her eyes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1">
"<span class="smcap">Dearest Girl</span>" (she read),&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="p1">"Just a line to save you from a shock at sight of me.
The old trouble&mdash;Peshawar fever. Mackay has run me to
earth at last and insisted on a Board. I'm afraid it's a
case of a year's sick leave at home, bad luck to it. But
I see no reason to throw up our fine plan altogether. If
you would like to wait out here for me, the Desmonds
will gladly give you a home. He made the offer at once,
and I know I couldn't leave you in better hands. Full
details when we meet. It's a hard blow for us both; but
you have grit enough for two, and here's a chance to
prove it. Hurry up that tonga-driver.&mdash;Your loving,</p>

<p class="p2">
<span class="smcap">John</span>."<br />
<br />
</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<p>Honor read the short letter through twice, then, with less
of elasticity in her step, sought refreshment of mind and
body in the hot water awaiting her in the next room.</p>

<p>An hour later the tonga was well on its way, speeding at a
hand-gallop over the dead level of road, with never an
incident of shade, or a spear-point of green, to soften the
forbidding face of it; with never a sound to shatter the
sunlit stillness, save the three-fold sound of their
going&mdash;the clatter of hoofs, the clank and rattle of the
tonga-bar rising and falling to a tune of its own making,
and the brazen-throated twang of the horn, which the
tonga-drivers of Upper India have elevated to a fine art.</p>

<p>And on either hand, to the utmost limit of vision, lay the
emptiness of the desert, bounded by unfriendly hills. A
pitiless country, where the line of duty smites the eye at
every turn; the line of beauty being conspicuous only by its
absence. A country that straightens the back, and strings up
nerve and muscle; where men learn to endure hardness, and
carry their lives in their hands with cheerful unconcern,
expecting and receiving small credit for either from those
whose safety they ensure, and who know little, and care
less, about matters so scantly relevant to their immediate
comfort or concern.</p>

<p>Honor had elected to sit in front by the strapping Pathan
driver; while Parbutti, ayah, her flow of speech frozen at
its source by the near neighbourhood of a sword and loaded
carbine, put as much space between the orderly and her own
small person as the narrow back-seat of the tonga would
permit.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<p>The English girl's eyes had in them now less of dreaminess,
and more of thought. The abrupt change in her outlook
brought Evelyn Desmond's pretty, effective figure to the
forefront of her mind. For ten years,&mdash;the period of Honor's
education in England,&mdash;the two girls had lived and learned
together as sisters; and, despite natures radically opposed,
a very real love had sprung up between them. They had not
met, however, since Evelyn Dacre's somewhat hasty marriage
to Captain Desmond, V.C., a brother officer of John
Meredith; a soldier of no little promise and distinction,
and a true frontiersman, both by heritage and inclination,
since every Desmond who came to India went straight to the
Border as a matter of course. Honor knew the man by hearsay
only, but she knew every inch of her friend's character, and
the knowledge gave her food for much interested speculation.
There are few things more puzzling than the marriages of our
friends, unless it be our own.</p>

<p>But after the first stoppage to change horses, Honor flung
meditation to the winds, and turned her eyes and mind upon
the life of the road. For, as day took completer possession
of the heavens, it became evident that life, of a leisurely,
intermittent sort, flourished even upon this highway to the
other end of nowhere.</p>

<p>A line of camels, strung together like a grotesque living
necklace, sauntered past, led by a loose-robed Pathan, as
supercilious of aspect as the shuffling brutes who bobbed
and gurgled in his wake. Or it might be a group of
bullock-carts going down to Kushalghur, to meet consignments
of stores and all the minor necessaries of life,&mdash;for in
those days Kohat was innocent of shops. At rare intervals,
colourless mud hamlets&mdash;each with its warlike
watch-tower&mdash;huddled close to the road as if for company and
protection. Here the monotonous round of life was already
astir. Women of a remarkable height and grace, in dark-blue
draperies peculiar to the Frontier, went about their work
with superb movement of untrammelled limbs, and groups of
shiny bronze babies shrilled to the heartsome notes of the
tonga-horn. There were also whitewashed police <i>chokhis</i>,
<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
where blue-coated, yellow-trousered policemen squatted, and
smoked, and spat, in glorious idleness, from dawn to dusk,
and exchanged full-flavoured compliments with the Pathan
driver in passing. For the rest there was always the
passionless serenity of the desert, with its crop of
thriftless thorn-bushes, whose berries showed like
blood-drops pricked from the hard heart of the land; and
beyond the desert, looming steadily nearer with every mile
of progress, the rugged majesty of the hills.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<p>As the third hour of their journeying drew to an end, a
sudden vision of green, like an emerald dropped on the drab
face of the plain, brought a flush to Honor's cheeks, a
light into her eyes.</p>

<p>"It is Kohat, Miss Sahib," the driver announced with a
comprehensive wave of his hand.</p>

<p>A breath of ice-cool air came to her from an open
watercourse at the roadside, and the fragrance of a hundred
roses from the one beautiful garden in the station that
surrounded the Deputy-Commissioner's house. They passed for
a while between overarching trees, but the glimpse of Eden
was short-lived. At the avenue's end they came abruptly into
the cantonment itself: stony, barren, unlovely, the dead
level broken here and there by rounded hummocks unworthy to
be called hills. On the east, behind a protective mud-wall,
lay the native city; on the north and west, the bungalows of
the little garrison&mdash;flat-roofed, square-shouldered
buildings, with lizard-haunted slits of windows fifteen feet
above the ground, set in the midst of bare, pebble-strewn
compounds; though here and there some fortunate boasted a
thirsty-looking tree, or a handful of rose-bushes blooming
bravely in this, the Indian month of roses.</p>

<p>At the foot of the highest hummock, crowned with buildings
of uniform ugliness, the tonga-driver drew rein and
indicated a steep pathway.</p>

<p>"The bungalow of the Major Sahib is above," he said, "and
the Presence must needs walk."</p>

<p>The Presence did more than walk. In the verandah at the
path's end a tall figure stood awaiting her; and before
Parbutti and the orderly had collected her belongings, she
was in John Meredith's arms.</p>

<p>The remarkable likeness between the two was very apparent as
they stood together thus; though the man's face was marred
by ill-health, and by the distressing prominence of his
eye-bones and strongly-marked jaw. He led her into the
dining-room with more of lover-like than brother-like
tenderness; for despite his forty years no woman had yet
dethroned this beautiful sister of his from the foremost
place in his heart.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>
<p>He set her down at the breakfast-table, himself poured out
her tea, and dismissed the kitmutgar as soon as might be,
Honor watching him the while with troubled solicitude in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"It's crushing, John!" she said at length. "And you do look
horribly ill."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear girl, is it likely I'd desert the regiment,
and forfeit a year of your good company unless devils within
were pretty imperative?"</p>

<p>She smiled and shook her head.</p>

<p>"But you ought to have told us about it sooner, ... me, at
any rate. When did you know the decision of the Board?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday. Desmond was with me at the time. I didn't write
before that about things being uncertain, for fear the good
old man should take fright and whisk you off home. And I
thought that even if I couldn't square the Board, you'd find
waiting out here for me the lesser evil."</p>

<p>"Very much the lesser evil. What a barbarian people at home
would think me if they knew it! And you must go, ... when?"</p>

<p>"In four or five days; as soon as my leave is sanctioned."</p>

<p>"And, naturally, I stay here with you till then."</p>

<p>"Well, ... partially. But when your heavy luggage came
yesterday, it seemed simpler to send it straight to the
Desmonds, and that you should settle in and sleep over
there. We're all sitting in one another's pockets here, and
you and I can be together all day, never fear. Will that
arrangement suit your Royal Highness?"</p>

<p>"My Royal Highness is as wax in your hands," she answered,
with a swift softening of face and voice. "I won't start
being autocratic till I get you back again. Only&mdash;sit down
at once, please. You don't look fit to stand."</p>

<p>He obeyed with unconcealed willingness, at the same time
handing her a note.</p>

<p>"It is from Mrs Desmond. She is expecting you over there
this afternoon."</p>

<p>Honor looked mutinous.</p>

<p>"But I want to stay with you. I shall see plenty of Evelyn
later."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p>"Still, I think we must spare her an hour to-day. The
little woman's keen to see you, and I'd like Desmond to feel
that we appreciate his prompt kindness. He'll be down at the
Lines all the afternoon. It's our day for tent-pegging. You
might ride down with Mrs Desmond, and bring me news of what
my men are doing. I'm mad at not being able to be there
myself."</p>

<p>She deserted her breakfast, and knelt down beside him.</p>

<p>"Dear man! Of course I'll go and find out all about it from
Captain Desmond. I needn't stay long to do that."</p>

<p>"No. You can say you want to get back to me. Desmond will
understand."</p>

<p>"He's rather a fine fellow, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"One of the best I know. The last man who ought to be
hampered by a woman."</p>

<p>"I might take that as a dismissal! How about yourself!"</p>

<p>"Ah, that's quite another matter." And he laid a hand upon
the soft abundance of her hair. "Mine is only a two years'
contract. And, in any case, <i>I</i> would never allow myself to
be handicapped by a woman&mdash;not even by you. But I don't feel
so certain about Desmond."</p>

<p>"Poor little Evelyn! Do you mean, ... is there any question
of her really hampering him, ... seriously?"</p>

<p>Meredith hesitated. A half-smile hovered in his tired eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<p>"As I'm strongly against the whole affair, and have hardly
forgiven him yet for marrying at all, it is fairer for me to
say nothing about her one way or the other. You must judge
for yourself."</p>

<h4>I WANT TO BE FIRST.</h4>

<div class="blockpoem">

<span style="margin-left: 6em;">"A breath of light, a pulse of tender fire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">Too dear for doubt, too driftless for desire."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 21.5em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Swinburne</span>.</span><br />
<br />
</div>

<p> <span class="smcap">Sixteen</span> months earlier, Evelyn Dacre&mdash;having come out to
India with a party of tourist friends&mdash;had chanced to spend
Christmas week at Lahore: a week which brings half the
Punjab together for purposes of festivity and sport. Here,
by some mysterious process, which no science will ever be
able to fathom or explain, she had cast an instantaneous and
unaccountable spell over a man of rare singleness of
purpose, whose heart was set to court action, danger,
hardship in every conceivable form: a man for whom a
girl-wife fresh out from "Home" seemed as hazardous an
investment as could well be imagined.</p>

<p>But with all his fine qualities of head and heart, Theo
Desmond was little given to cool deliberation in the
critical moments of life. This chance-met girl, fragile as a
flower and delicately tinted as a piece of porcelain, full
of enthusiasm for her new surroundings and of a delight half
shy, half spontaneous in the companionship of a man so
unlike the <i>blasé</i>, self-centred youths of her limited
experience, had, for the time being, swept him off his feet.
And men are apt to do unaccountable things during those
hot-headed moments when the feet are actually off the
ground.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<p>A moonlight picnic; an hour of isolated wandering in a
garden of tombs; the witchery of the moment; the word too
much; the glance that lingered to a look;&mdash;and the
irrevocable was upon them. Desmond had returned to the
Frontier, to a circle of silently amazed brother officers;
and in less than three months from their time of meeting the
two had become man and wife.</p>

<p>Honor, having been away in England at the time, had had but
a second-hand hearing of the whole affair; and for all the
keenness of her present disappointment, a natural spark of
interest was aroused in her at the prospect of spending a
year with this unequally yoked husband and wife.</p>

<p>She found her friend awaiting her in the verandah: a mere
slip of womanhood, in a grey habit.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>there</i> you are at last, Honor!" she cried eagerly.
"It's grand to see you again! I'm dreadfully sorry about
Major Meredith&mdash;I am, truly. But it's just lovely getting
you on a long visit like this. Come in and have tea before
we start."</p>

<p>And taking possession of the girl with both hands, she led
her into the house, talking ceaselessly as she went.</p>

<p>"It's really very charming of you two to be so pleased to
have me," Honor said quietly, as she settled herself,
nothing loth, in the spaciousness of Captain Desmond's
favourite chair. Then, because her head still hummed with
the clatter of travel, she fell silent; following with her
eyes the movements of this graceful girl-wife, whose
engaging air of frankness and simplicity was discounted, at
times, by an odd lack of both dimly shadowed in the
blue-green eyes.</p>

<p>Evelyn Desmond's eyes were, not without reason, her dearest
bit of vanity. The tint of the clear iris suggested sea
shallows on a day of light cloud&mdash;more green than blue; yet
with just enough of the sky's own colour to lend the charm
of a constant variability, that harmonised admirably with
her iridescent changes of mood.</p>

<p>Honor Meredith, who understood her curious mingling of charm
and unsatisfactoriness better than any one else in the
world, noted her afresh, inwardly and outwardly, with the
result that she desired more than ever to know the man who
had been hardy enough to place his life's happiness in the
hollow of Evelyn's clinging, incompetent hands.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<p>At this juncture Mrs Desmond sank on to a low stool beside
her, set her own cup and plate unceremoniously on the
carpet, and laid a caressing hand upon her knee.</p>

<p>"It <i>does</i> feel like old times," she said. "And I so badly
want to show you to Theo."</p>

<p>The young simplicity of the words brought a very soft light
into Honor's eyes.</p>

<p>"I promised John I would go down just in order to be 'shown
to Theo,'" she answered smiling. "But you must put off
showing me to the rest till another day. I'm a little tired:
and I can't keep my mind off John for very long just now."</p>

<p>"You still love him better than any one in the world, then?"</p>

<p>"Isn't the fact of my coming here to stay two years
sufficient proof of that?"</p>

<p>"The very greatest proof imaginable!" Mrs Desmond flung out
her hands with a pretty, characteristic gesture. "I'm only
wondering if you know what you've let yourself in for? I
thought India was a lovely placed <i>till</i> I came here. Theo
warned me it wouldn't be a bit like Pindi or Lahore. But
that didn't seem to matter, so long as I had him. Only I am
so seldom <i>able</i> to have him! The regiment swamps
<i>every</i>thing. The men are always in uniform, and always at
it; and the aggravating part is that they actually like that
better than anything."</p>

<p>Honor laid her hand over the one that rested on her knee.
She saw both sides of the picture with equal vividness.</p>

<p>"What a dire calamity!" she said gently. "I am afraid that
on the Frontier, if a man is keen, his wife is bound to
stand second; and if only she will accept the fact, it must
surely be happier for both in the long-run."</p>

<p>Mrs Desmond looked up at her with pathetic eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<p>"But I don't <i>want</i> to accept the fact. I want to be first
always: and I ought to be. It's easy enough for <i>you</i> to
talk, because you haven't a notion how nice Theo is! When
you've married a man like that, and buried yourself in a
howling wilderness because of him, he ought to belong more
to you than to his sacred Frontier Force! But Theo seems to
be the private property of half the regiment! There's his
chief friend Major Wyndham, and the Boy, his subaltern, he
thinks the world of them; and they seem to live in the
house. Then there's a tiresome old Ressaldar always coming
over to do Persian with him for his Higher Proficiency exam;
and I don't find it half amusing to be one of a mixed crowd
like that!"</p>

<p>Her whimsical air of woe disarmed all save the mildest
disapproval. It was one of Evelyn Desmond's unfair
advantages that she always did manage to disarm disapproval,
even in her least admirable moments; and the smile deepened
in Honor's eyes.</p>

<p>"It seems to me, Evelyn," she said quietly, "that your
husband must be a very large-hearted man."</p>

<p>"Why, of course! That's just the trouble, ... don't you
see?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do see; and I am woman enough to sympathise. But it
will do you no harm, dear, to be one of a crowd, and to get
out of the glass case you have been kept under ever since
you were born. Show me this wonderful Theo now. People's
faces tell me a great deal, you know; and you have roused my
curiosity."</p>

<p>"Look round and see if you can recognise him," was the
laughing answer.</p>

<p>There were some half-dozen photographs of men, in uniform
and out of it, set about the incongruous room; but the
girl's eyes were speedily caught and riveted by a
full-length presentment of a Punjab cavalryman, which stood,
solitary and conspicuous, on the upright piano. She rose and
went quickly towards it.</p>

<p>"I choose here," she said decisively. "Am I right?" And
seeing that Evelyn nodded, she went on: "What a very
remarkable picture. So extraordinarily alive! One can see
how he hates standing still inside that frame!"</p>

<p>Then she fell into a long silence: for she was a practised
observer of men and things, and the face before her
compelled attention. The keynote of the whole was vigour:
not mere impetuosity, though that was present also, but a
sustained, indwelling vigour, that keeps endeavour bright.</p>

<p>Evelyn stood watching her in no little wonderment, awaiting
further comment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>
<p>"Don't you like him?" she asked at length.</p>

<p>"Decidedly; if that picture does him justice."</p>

<p>"Well, come on down to the tent-pegging, and find out for
yourself."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>From the bungalows crowning the mound a bare road sloped
northward to the cavalry lines. Along it the two women rode
at a foot's pace; for Evelyn still had much to say, and the
girl was a notable listener. But even so the parade-ground
below them came rapidly into view&mdash;a level expanse of brown
earth, hard as a usurer's heart, varied only by lines of
featureless mud huts, and backed by the dragon's teeth of
the hills, brown also, save where sharply defined shadows
broke the prevailing monotony of hue.</p>

<p>But the foreground of this toneless setting vibrated with
life, movement, colour.</p>

<p>Groups of native troopers, in blue belted tunics and turbans
of blue and gold, occupied the central space. English
officers, in undress uniform, rode to and fro among them,
criticising, encouraging, and generally directing the course
of events. In an open <i>shamianah</i>,
<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> eight or ten men
divided their attention between a table at the back of the
tent and the four ladies of the station, who perforce
converted military events into those friendly gatherings
which are the mainstay of Anglo-Indian life. Native
onlookers, of all races and ranks, formed a mosaic border to
the central theme; and a jumble of rollicking Irish airs
from the Sikh band set Honor's foot tapping the air with
brisk precision.</p>

<p>"Wait, Evelyn," she said. "I would like to see those four
Pathans take the pegs from here. One gets the effect better
from rising ground."</p>

<p>And Evelyn, whose knowledge of effects was limited to hats
and hairdressing, drew rein obediently, her eyes probing the
crowd for the one figure, to whom the rest were mere
accessories, and rather troublesome accessories at that.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<p>But Honor's eyes and mind were set upon the four Pathans
drawn up in line at the starting-point, the sunlight
flashing from their lance-heads, and from every link of
eight steel shoulder-chains; their faces inscrutable; their
eyes points of living fire. A pathway of straw softened the
ground for galloping, and in the midst of it four pegs
awaited the furious onset.</p>

<p>The horses, all eagerness to be off, tossed impatient heads,
straining impotently at the tightened rein. On a given word
they sprang forward with a thundering rush of hoofs,
swooping down upon the pegs at lightning speed, the men's
faces level with the flying manes, their lance-heads
skimming the ground. Followed the stirring moment of impact,
the long-drawn shout, steadily rising to a yell of triumph,
as four lances whirled aloft, each bearing the coveted
morsel of wood spiked through the centre.</p>

<p>The girl drew a deep breath, and her face glowed with that
pagan exultation in bodily strength and prowess, which all
the refining fires of civilisation will never burn out of
the human heart. But as she turned with praise on her lips,
Evelyn leaned eagerly towards her.</p>

<p>"Theo has seen us. He is coming up here. Look!"</p>

<p>And Honor looked accordingly.</p>

<p>A man on a superb bay "waler" had detached himself from the
crowd, and was coming towards them at a swinging trot,
sitting the horse as though he were part of the animal.
Honor realised at a glance that here was that stimulating
thing, a positive personality alive to the finger-tips,
realised also with what success the photographer had caught
and rendered the living essence of the man. Desmond was dark
as his wife was fair, though a hint of chestnut in his
moustache, and a peculiar light in the hazel-grey eyes,
suggested fire not far below the surface. The whole face was
stamped with that sovereign quality of sympathy which, even
in a world of failure, never fails of its reward.</p>

<p>His wife effected an introduction in her own ingenuous
fashion. "There, Theo, ... this is Honor, that you have
heard so much about."</p>

<p>Desmond saluted.</p>

<p>"I'm uncommonly glad to meet you, Miss Meredith," he said;
but before Honor could reply Evelyn made haste to interpose.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
<p>"Theo, ... I can't have you calling her Miss Meredith!
She's just like my sister, and you must simply be Honor and
Theo, ... d'you see?"</p>

<p>Desmond's eyes showed a flicker of amusement.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'll allow us to shake hands first," he
suggested, and the friendliness of his grasp dispelled the
sense of isolation that weighed upon the girl at thought of
her brother's departure.</p>

<p>"How did that last performance strike you? Pretty good,
wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Splendid. They went by like a wall. Such magnificent
riding."</p>

<p>"They were your brother's men. Wish he could have seen them.
He's so tremendously keen. They've tied with my Sikhs, so
there'll be an exciting finish. Won't you come down and see
it out?"</p>

<p>"I think not, thanks, if it doesn't seem unfriendly. I
really only came because John and Evelyn wished it, just to
make your acquaintance and see how things were going, and I
would honestly like to go straight back to him now, ... if I
may. He said you would understand."</p>

<p>"He was right. I'll see you to the gate myself. Go on down
to the <i>shamianah</i>, Ladybird, the Boy is looking out for
you. I'll not be gone long."</p>

<p>And with a rebellious crumpling of her forehead Evelyn
obeyed.</p>

<p>"I am afraid the Major's news must have been rather a shock
to you, Miss Meredith," Desmond went on, as their horses
mounted the slope. "But we've all been expecting it this
long while. He takes too little leave and steadily overworks
himself, ... that's the truth. But then, ... you should see
what he's done for the regiment in the last ten years!"</p>

<p>The spark of enthusiasm in the man's tone struck an
answering spark from his companion.</p>

<p>"That's the true way to look at it," she declared warmly.
"So many people simply call him a fool. It's the fashion to
sneer at enthusiasm in these days."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>
<p>"We don't sneer at it in this part of the world," Desmond
replied with quiet emphasis. "I see now why the Major said I
should find you the right sort for the Frontier and a help
to ... my Evelyn. I have transplanted her to a very rough
soil, I only hope she's fit to stand it."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> think so. She has been too carefully sheltered till
now; and it's just a matter of adapting herself to fresh
conditions. You may count on me to do all I can for her
while I am here."</p>

<p>"Your name is sufficient guarantee for that!" he answered
simply; and the implied compliment to her brother quickened
every pulse in her body.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<p>They parted at Major Meredith's gate, Desmond promising to
report the result of the final contest on his way home; and
the girl sat watching him thoughtfully till a dip in the
road hid him from view.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honor</span> woke early, springing from dreamless sleep to alert
wakefulness, as is the way of vivid natures, and the first
sight that greeted her was the huddled form of Parbutti, her
chin between her knees, her dark eyes bright and watchful.</p>

<p>Honor's smile was answered by a flash of light across the
old woman's face as she arose and salaamed to the ground.</p>

<p>"Behold, while the Miss Sahib slept like a little child, I
have laid out the riding-gear as of custom, and now I go to
prepare the <i>terail</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a>

<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
They are not ill folk in this compound, Hazúr; and there goes but one
word among them, that our Sahib is a diamond fit for a king's turban,
understanding the heart of black men, giving no shame words, neither
smiting with his foot as do many officer-sahibs. It is well for us,
who come strangers to a country of murderers, to be of the household
of such a Sahib. Nay, then, child of my heart, I will cease from idle
talk, ... it is an order. Doth not my pearl and the light of my life
await her chota hazri?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<p>And the old woman, whose garrulity was as dust in the
balance when weighed against twenty years of faithful
service, shuffled out of the room.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Honor was in the saddle&mdash;a gallant figure
in well-cut brown habit and white helmet, the sunlight
finding out gleams of bronze in her abundant hair, while all
about her shone the uncompromising blue and gold of a
mid-March morning&mdash;fresh without sharpness, and fragrant
with the ethereal fragrance of dawn.</p>

<p>She followed the downward road, noting a landmark here and
there for guidance. Her delight was in the rhythm of
movement; in the waiting stillness of earth and sky; the
momentous pause between all that has been, and all that
shall be, which gives a dramatic sense of responsibility to
the day's first hours.</p>

<p>Her eyes rejoiced in the least detail of form and light and
colour; in the signs of reviving life; the alert ubiquitous
sentries, the sharp alternations of sun and shadow on hills
naked and unpromising as the harsh face of poverty; hills
that for all time have had but one gift for the giving&mdash;"not
peace, but a sword." From the cavalry Lines behind her the
trumpet call to "stables" set the blood stirring in her
veins, with that peculiar thrill which no other instrument
can produce. The very spirit of battle breathes in the
sound.</p>

<p>An expectant interest glowed within her like a star. It was
her great good-fortune to be blessed with that poetic
understanding which is neither deceived by custom nor dulled
by repetition, which sees all things&mdash;even the most
familiar&mdash;virginally fresh, as on the morning of creation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>
<p>Her random wanderings brought her to a stretch of
un-metalled road, and at the road's edge, some few hundred
yards away a man on a white horse had drawn rein at sight of
her. Instantly her thought alighted on Evelyn's husband, but
nearer view revealed a different type of man&mdash;taller, and
equally erect, yet lacking in the suggestion of force and
virility that emanated from Captain Desmond, even in repose.
With a rapidity born of much practice Honor took stock of
him, from his helmet to his boots, as he sat awaiting her,
with a coolness which at once amused her and piqued her
interest. A slim square chin, indeterminate colouring, and
eyes of a remarkable thoughtfulness under very level brows,
went to make up a satisfying, if not very striking whole.</p>

<p>"A modest, understanding sort of man," was Honor's mental
verdict. "A student every inch of him. I wonder how in the
world he comes to be a soldier."</p>

<p>By this time Dilkusha had been drawn up, and the man who
ought not to have been a soldier was saluting her with a
singularly charming smile, that began in the eyes, and broke
up the gravity of the face as sunshine breaks up a cloud.</p>

<p>"You must be Miss Meredith," he said. "One doesn't meet a
new face haphazard in Kohat, and ... you are wonderfully
like your brother. I am Major Wyndham. You may have heard
the name?"</p>

<p>"Why, ... yes. You are Captain Desmond's friend."</p>

<p>"You couldn't give a completer description of me! I hear you
are to put up with them till Meredith comes back."</p>

<p>"Yes. They have been quite charming about it, and I am so
glad not to be driven away from the Frontier at once. I have
been longing to get to it for years."</p>

<p>He watched her while she spoke, his quietly observant eyes
missing no detail of her face.</p>

<p>"And now you have got here, I wonder how it will strike you
after the imposing official circles of Simla and Lahore.
You'll find none of the 'beer and skittles' of the country
up here. But the Frontier has its own fascination all the
same; especially when a man has the spirit of it in his
blood. Desmond, for instance, wouldn't give a brass farthing
for life out of sight of those hard-featured hills. Do you
know him and his wife at all?"</p>

<p>"I never saw him till yesterday, except in the distance at
polo matches. But I have known her since she was quite a
child."</p>

<p>"And I have known Desmond since he was thirteen. Rather odd!
You can't fail to be good friends with <i>him</i> Miss Meredith."</p>

<p>"Are you as rabid as my brother and the Colonel because the
poor man has dared to marry?" she asked, with an incurable
directness which to some natures was a stumbling-block, and
to others her chiefest charm. "It seems to be a part of the
regimental creed."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
<p>"It is. And I subscribe to it ... <i>as</i> a creed. But my
belief has not yet been tried in the fire. Desmond is the
keenest soldier I know; yet he has seen fit to marry. I have
an immense faith in him, and, whatever others may think, I
prefer to reserve my judgment."</p>

<p>"If only a few more of us had the wisdom to do that," the
girl said softly. "How much easier life would be for every
one!"</p>

<p>Wyndham smiled.</p>

<p>"I have a notion that life isn't meant to be easy," he said.
"And the fact remains that Meredith and the Colonel are
right in principle. Few men are strong enough to stand the
strain of being pulled two ways at once, and marriage is
bound to be a grave risk for a man whose heart is set on
soldiering&mdash;Frontier soldiering above all. But then Desmond
loves a risk better than anything else in life."</p>

<p>And with an abrupt laugh he dismissed the subject.</p>

<p>"I must be going on now," he added. "But no doubt we shall
meet again soon. I am constantly over at the bungalow."</p>

<p>And, saluting her again, he trotted leisurely northward to
the cavalry Lines.</p>

<p>His thoughts as he went hovered about the girl. The mere
picture she left upon his brain was not one to be lightly
set aside by a man with an ardent eye for the beautiful, and
a spirit swift to discern those hidden elements which gave
to Honor Meredith's beauty its distinctive quality and
charm.</p>

<p>Some men are born with a genius for looking on at life, a
form of genius not to be despised. They are of the type from
which great naturalists, great philosophers are made; men
quick to perceive, slow to assert; men whose large patience
rests upon freedom from the fret of personal desire. Of such
was Paul Wyndham, and in his accepted rôle of onlooker he
fell to pondering upon the new element in his own immediate
drama.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>If only Desmond had chosen for his helpmate such a girl as
Miss Meredith, how different might have been the regiment's
feelings in regard to the unwelcome fact of his marriage.
Yet Wyndham was aware of an instant recoil from the idea,
aware that he personally preferred matters as they stood.
With which conclusion he spurred his horse to a canter, as
though he could thus outrun the quickened current of thought
and feeling which this unlooked-for meeting had set stirring
in his brain.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Meantime Honor Meredith had fallen in with another member of
her newly-adopted family:&mdash;a big, raw-boned Irishwoman, who
wore her curling reddish hair cropped short, answered to the
name of "Frank," and dressed chronically in a serviceable
skirt and covert coat, and a man's shikarri helmet. When
riding, the skirt was replaced by that of a country-made
habit; and in the simplest evening gown this large-featured,
large-hearted woman stood a martyr confessed. For ten years
she had been the only woman in a regiment of sworn
bachelors; had nursed her "brother officers" whenever need
arose; had shared their interests, their hardships, their
amusements; till,&mdash;in the symbolism of the India she
loved,&mdash;they and the regiment had become "her father and her
mother, her people and her God."</p>

<p>At sight of Honor she hurried her grey country-bred across
the road, and held out a square, loosely-gloved hand.</p>

<p>"It's bound to be Miss Meredith!" she exclaimed, in a
pronounced brogue, with a flash of white even teeth&mdash;her
sole claim to beauty. "It's very welcome you are to Kohat
and to the regiment. I'm Frank Olliver, ... Captain
Olliver's wife. I'll turn now and ride back a bit of the way
with you. Then we can talk as we go. 'Tis the worst of bad
luck about your brother. When'll he be leaving?"</p>

<p>"In four or five days. He moves across into our bungalow
this morning. It was splendid of Captain Desmond to think of
it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ah, Theo's just made that way!" Then, noting a glimmer of
surprise in Honor's face, her wide smile shone out once
more. "Is it shocked you are because I speak of him so?
Well, ... truth is, I'm a privileged person since I pulled
him through typhoid seven years ago, when by rights he
should have died. I'm a rare hand, anyway, at dropping the
formalities with them that suit me taste. Though, by the
same token, I've taken no liberties with little Mrs Desmond
yet. It's queer. We don't seem to get much further with her;
though we'd be glad enough to do it for Theo's sake. You
mustn't mind straight speech from me, Miss Meredith. Sure I
must have been born with the whole truth in me mouth, for as
fast as I open me lips a bit of it slips out. I'll be
finding she's your half-sister, or first cousin, or some
such thing!"</p>

<p>Honor laughed outright. It would clearly be impossible to
take amiss anything that this woman might choose to say. The
kindliness of her soul shone through her plain face, like
sunlight through a window-pane.</p>

<p>"Her mother is a distant connection of ours," the girl
admitted frankly. "And we were brought up for a time like
sisters. It must have been rather a startling change for her
from a country town at home to a Border station; and she is
very young still, and very devoted to her husband."</p>

<p>"She is that, ... after a queer fashion of her own. But
Theo's bound to make his mark on the Frontier, like his
father before him; and you know the proverb, 'He travels the
fastest who travels alone.' Tis hardly meself, though, that
should be upholding such a saying as that!"</p>

<p>"No, indeed! No woman ought to uphold it. And, after all,"
Honor added, with a very becoming touch of seriousness,
"there may be better things for a man than to travel fast.
He may learn more by travelling slowly, don't you think? And
I should imagine that fast or slow, Captain Desmond is bound
to arrive in the end&mdash;Now I must turn in here, and see if
John is awake. I'll come and see you when he is gone. I can
spare no time for any one else till then!"</p>

<p>Frank Olliver beamed in unqualified approbation.</p>

<p>"You're just a brick, Miss Meredith," she declared with
ready Irish warmth. "An' 'twas a fine wind indeed that
carried you up to Kohat."</p>

<p>Honor found her hand enclosed in a grasp as strong as a
man's; and three minutes later Mrs Olliver&mdash;whose seat on a
horse was as ungainly as her hand on its mouth was
perfect&mdash;had become a mere speck on the wide sunlit road.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<p>Honor entered the hall of her new home pondering many
things. She laid aside her sun helmet, and in obedience to
the promptings of her interested soul turned her steps
toward the drawing-room.</p>

<p>The door was ajar, and passing between the looped gold and
white <i>phulkaris</i>, she came to a standstill; for the room
was not empty.</p>

<p>Captain Desmond, in undress uniform, sat at the piano with
his back towards her. His white helmet lay, spike downward,
on the carpet; and an Aberdeen terrier&mdash;ears rigidly erect,
head tilted at a critical angle&mdash;sat close beside it,
watching his master with intent eyes, in which all the
wisdom and sorrow of the ages seemed writ.</p>

<p>While the girl hesitated on the threshold, Desmond struck a
succession of soft chords in a minor key; and she stood
spellbound, determined to hear more. Music was no mere
accomplishment to her, but a simple necessity of life; and
this man possessed that rare gift of touch, which no master
in the world can impart, because it is a produce neither of
hand nor brain, but of the player's individual soul.
Desmond's fingers were unpractised, but he gave every note
its true value; and he played slowly, as though composing
each chord as it came, or building it up from memory. It was
almost as if he were thinking aloud; and Honor had just
decided that she really had no business to be overhearing
his thoughts, when an apprehensive "woof" from the Aberdeen
brought them suddenly to an end.</p>

<p>Desmond swung round upon the music-stool, and at sight of
her sprang up hastily, a dull flush showing through his tan.</p>

<p>"Amar Singh told me you were out," he said, as they shook
hands.</p>

<p>"So I was. I only came in this minute. Won't you let me hear
a little more, please?"</p>

<p>He shook his head with good-humoured decision.</p>

<p>"I never play to any one ... except Rob, who, being a Scots
Covenanter, disapproves on principle."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<p>"I call that selfish. It's such a rare treat to hear a man
play well. I was delighted when you began. I thought pianos
were unheard of up here."</p>

<p>"Well, ... they are hardly a legitimate item in a Frontier
officer's equipment! This one was ... my mother's," he laid
a hand on the instrument, as though it had been the shoulder
of a friend. "The fellows sat upon me, I assure you, when I
brought it out. Told me it was worse than a wife. But I've
carried my point, ... wife and all. And now, perhaps you
will reward me,&mdash;if I haven't been too ungracious to deserve
it?"</p>

<p>He whisked away his solitary photo, and opened the piano.</p>

<p>"How do you know I play?" she asked, smiling. She liked his
impetuosity of movement and speech.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I guessed it last night. You carry it in your
head?"</p>

<p>"Yes; most of it."</p>

<p>"Real music? The big chaps?"</p>

<p>"Very little else, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"No need to put it that way here, Miss Meredith. A sonata,
please. The Pathetic."</p>

<p>She sat down to the piano with a little quickening of the
breath and let her fingers rest a moment on the keyboard.
Then&mdash;sudden, crisp, and vigorous came the crash of the
opening chord.</p>

<p>Honor Meredith's playing was of a piece with her own
nature&mdash;vivid, wholesome, impassioned. Her supple fingers
drew the heart out of each wire. Yet she did not find it
necessary to sway her body to and fro; but sat square and
upright, her head a little lifted, as though evolving the
music from her soul.</p>

<p>Desmond listened motionless to the opening bars; then, with
a long breath of satisfaction, moved away, and fell to
pacing the room.</p>

<p>The Scots Covenanter, scenting the joyful possibility of
escape, trotted hopefully to heel: but, being a dog of
discernment, speedily detected the fraud, and retired to the
hearth-rug in disgust. Thence he scrutinised his master's
irrational method of taking exercise, unfeigned contempt in
every line of him, from nose-tip to tail.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>
<p>The sonata ended, Honor let her hands fall into her lap,
and sat very still. She had lost all thought of her
companion in the joy of interpretation; but Desmond's voice
at her side recalled her to reality.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said. "I haven't heard it played like <i>that</i>
... for five years. If you can do much of this sort of thing
you'll find me insatiable. We're bound to be good friends at
this rate, and I see no reason why we should not comply with
Ladybird's request to us. Do you, ... Honor?"</p>

<p>She started and flushed at the sound of her name; then
turned her clear eyes full upon him, the shadow of a smile
lifting the rebellious corners of her mouth.</p>

<p>"No reason at all, ... in good time, Captain Desmond."</p>

<p>He returned her look with an equal deliberation.</p>

<p>"Is that a hint to me to keep my distance?"</p>

<p>"No. Only to ... 'go slow,' if you'll forgive the expressive
slang. It's so much wiser in the long-run."</p>

<p>"Is it? Bad luck for me. I've never managed it yet, and I
doubt if I ever shall. The men of my squadron call me
<i>Bijli-wallah Sahib</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and I didn't earn the name by going
slow, ... Miss Meredith. If I have been overbold, your music
was to blame. But Ladybird seemed to wish it; and, believe
me, I did <i>not</i> mean it to seem like impertinence. Why,
there she is herself, bless her; and we're neither of us
ready for breakfast!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h4>ESPECIALLY WOMEN.</h4>

<div class="blockpoem">
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"We are fearfully and wonderfully made&mdash;
especially women."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Thackeray.</span></span><br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> afternoon sunlight flung lengthening shadows across the
cavalry Lines, where men and native officers alike were
housed in mud-plastered huts, innocent of windows; and where
life was beginning to stir anew after the noontide
tranquillity of the East.</p>

<p>The eighty horses of each troop stood, picketed with ample
lengths of head and heel rope, between the lines of huts
occupied by their sowars; while at the permanently open
doorways squatted the men themselves,&mdash;Sikhs,
Punjabi-Mahomedans, Pathans, each troop composed entirely of
one or the other,&mdash;smoking, gambling, or putting final
touches to their toilet in the broad light of day. The
native officers alone aspired to a certain degree of
privacy. Their huts were detached a little space from those
that guarded the horses; and flimsy walls of grass matting,
set around them, imparted a suggestion of dignity and
aloofness from the common herd.</p>

<p>The hut of Jemadar Alla Dad Khan, of the Pathan troop of
Desmond's squadron, boasted just such a matting wall, with a
gateless gateway, even as in the bungalows of Sahibs; and
withinsides all was very particularly set in order. There
was an air of festivity in the open courtyard, on either
side of which lay two smoke-grimed rooms, that made up the
entire house.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>
<p>For this was a red-letter day in the eyes of the Jemadar,
and of Fatma Bibi, his wife, who had spent a full hour in
adorning her plump person, and emphasising its charms
according to the peculiar methods of the East. That done,
she came forth into the sunlight, attired as becomes a
Mahomedan woman who is expecting a visit of ceremony. Above
her mysteriously draped trousers she wore a sleeveless coat,
adorned with crescent-shaped pockets and a narrow gold
braid. A <i>sari</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> of gold-flecked muslin was draped over
her head and shoulders, and beneath it her heavily oiled
hair made a wide triangle of her forehead. The scarlet of
betel-nut was upon her lips; the duskiness of kol shadowed
her lashes. Ornaments of glass and silver encircled her neck
and arms, and were lavishly festooned around her delicate
ears.</p>

<p>Her entire bearing exhaled satisfied vanity like a perfume,
as she sat at ease upon a bare <i>charpoy</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> watching her
husband's preparations for the expected guests.</p>

<p>He was arrayed in full-dress uniform, even to the two
cherished medals on his chest; and his appearance sorted
strangely with the peaceful nature of his occupation.</p>

<p>In the midst of the courtyard he had set forth&mdash;not without
a secret glow of pride&mdash;as exact an imitation of the Sahibs'
"afternoon tea" as his limited knowledge and resources would
permit. From the mess khansamah he had borrowed a japanned
tea-tray that had seen much service, a Rockingham teapot,
chipped at the spout, two blue-rimmed cups and saucers, and
half a dozen plates, which last he had set round the table
at precisely equal distances from each other. Two of them
were left empty for the use of his guests, and the other
four were piled with dainties suitable for so high an
occasion&mdash;sugar-topped biscuits (beloved of natives
throughout the land), raw pistachio nuts, Cabul grapes and
oranges. Then, because the central space had a barren
aspect, the sugar-bowl was promoted to the place of honour
for lack of a more suitable adornment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>
<p>The only two chairs the courtyard contained were set
opposite to one another, and it was uplifting to reflect
that in a short time they would be occupied by his captain's
own Memsahib and the Generailly Sahib's Miss, they having,
of their great condescension accepted his hospitality by the
gracious favour of the Captain Sahib himself.</p>

<p>"According to this fashion, are all things made ready, O
Fatma Bibi, when there is a tea-drinking in the bungalows of
Sahibs," he announced, for the enlightenment of his wife,
who had seen little of the world beyond the four mud walls
roofed by her private patch of sky, and therefore could not
be expected to have accurate acquaintance with the
mysterious ways of Sahibs.</p>

<p>Fatma Bibi acknowledged the information with just such a nod
as a mother might bestow on a contented child. Despite her
limited experience of the outer world, she knew herself many
degrees wiser than her husband in matters of far greater
moment than the setting out of a few plates and cups after
the manner of the Sahib-log, who, in respect of food and
feeding are completely and comprehensively "without sense,"
as all India knows.</p>

<p>"Bear in mind also," the man went on, sublimely unconscious
of his wife's indulgent attitude, "that the Memsahib knoweth
the simplest words of Hindostani only; but Meredith Miss
Sahib will render our speech unto her, making all things
clear. Behold&mdash;they come."</p>

<p>The sound of hoofs, and the thud of a "dandy" set down
outside confirmed his words; and not many minutes later the
Jemadar ushered two Englishwomen into the presence of his
wife,&mdash;Evelyn, looking more flower-like than usual, in a
many-frilled gown of creamy muslin and a big simple hat to
match.</p>

<p>"By the goodness of the Captain Sahib's heart my house is
honoured beyond deserving," the man gave them greeting as
they crossed the threshold, while Fatma Bibi's eyes rested
in frank curiosity upon the exceeding whiteness and
simplicity of the English "Mem," whose appearance was so
direct a contrast to her own.</p>

<p>"Without doubt these women of <i>Belait</i>
<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
possess no true beauty," she assured herself, with a nod of
satisfaction, as she resumed her seat and the new-comers accepted
their appointed chairs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a strange meal, and Evelyn Desmond was, in all
respects, the least happy of the oddly assorted quartette.
She made a conscientious, if not very successful, effort to
drink the pale block tea, and eat the strange mixture of
foods pressed upon her by the Jemadar, who would obviously
feel disheartened if his guests did not empty all four
plates at a sitting. Nor was this the least of her troubles.
Fatma Bibi's valiant attempts at conversation filled her
with a bewilderment and discomfort, bordering on irritation.
In an impulse of childish wickedness, she caught herself
wishing heartily that Theo had never seen fit to distinguish
himself by saving the Jemadar's life.</p>

<p>She looked enviously across the table at Honor, who, by a
few spontaneous questions, set both at their ease. She spoke
of her father, and the man's face glowed.</p>

<p>"How should men forget the Generailly Sahib, who have beheld
him, as did we of the <i>Rissalar</i>,
<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> in war time, leading
men and horses and guns through the terrible mountain
country beyond Peshawur? We that serve the British Raj, Miss
Sahib, are not men of ready tongue; but our hearts are slow
to forget."</p>

<p>In proof thereof, the good Jemadar&mdash;his tongue effectually
unloosed for the moment&mdash;regaled his guests with tale upon
tale of bygone raids and murders and of swift retribution
meted out by those watch-dogs of the Border, the Punjab
Frontier Force; tales set forth with the Oriental touch of
exaggeration which lent colour to a narrative already
sufficiently inspiring.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
<p>"These things have I seen, Miss Sahib," he concluded, with
a sudden deepening of his voice, "and these things have I
done, through the godlike courage of my Captain Sahib
Bahadur"&mdash;the man saluted on the words&mdash;"who, in the
beginning of my service, when I lay wounded almost to the
death, amid bullets that fell like hail, bore me to safety
on his own shoulders, earning thereby the Victoria Cross
that he weareth even now. True talk, Hazúr. Among all the
officer Sahibs of Hind, and I have seen more than a few,
there be none like unto my Captain Sahib for courage and
greatness of heart."</p>

<p>At this point Evelyn's voice broke in on a note of querulous
weariness.</p>

<p>"Do come away, Honor. I've eaten queer things enough to give
me indigestion for a week; and I can't understand a word any
one is saying. What was he getting so excited about just
now?"</p>

<p>"Something that must make you feel a very proud woman,
Evelyn," the girl answered; and with a thrill in her low
voice she translated the man's last words.</p>

<p>Mrs Desmond flushed softly; praise of her husband being only
a few degrees less acceptable than praise of herself.</p>

<p>"It sounds very magnificent," she agreed, without
enthusiasm, "but I daresay he doesn't really mean half of
it. These natives never do. Anyway, please say the polite
and proper things and let's get home as soon as possible.
I'm sure we've done enough to satisfy even Theo by this
time."</p>

<p>And Honor, who would fain have listened to their host for
another half-hour, had no choice but to obey.</p>

<p>"Why, Evelyn," she said, as they left the striped sun and
shadow of the lines, "you never told me that Captain Desmond
won his V.C. by saving the Jemadar's life. I want to hear
all about it, please."</p>

<p>Evelyn smiled, and shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"You probably know as much as I do. Theo never <i>will</i> tell
about himself. Besides, in my own heart, I think he was
rather foolish to risk getting killed several times over
just for the sake of a <i>native</i>." The scorn that some few
Anglo-Indians never lose lurked in her tone. "Of course it's
very nice for him to have the V.C., and I suppose he thought
it was worth while just for that. But I hope he won't go in
for any <i>more</i> things of that sort. There's <i>me</i> to be
considered now."</p>

<p>Such peculiar views on the subject of heroism smote Honor to
silence, and with a hurried murmur that Dilkusha seemed
impatient to get home she set the mare into a trot.</p>

<p>Arrived in the cool dimness of her own drawing-room, Evelyn
Desmond sank gratefully into a chair, her skirts billowing
softly about her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>
<p>"How refreshing it is here, after that glaring courtyard!
This place is getting too hot already. I <i>do</i> wish Theo
would let me go to Simla again this year. Last season the
Walters asked him to let me join them; and it was simply
lovely. Though I didn't half like leaving him behind; and I
suppose I shan't like it much this year either."</p>

<p>"Then why go at all?" suggested practical Honor. "You're not
obliged to. Surely Mrs Olliver stays?"</p>

<p>"Mrs Olliver! She's not a woman! She's a Regimental
Institution. I can't think <i>what</i> the men see in her to make
such a fuss about! A plain, badly-made Irishwoman, who
dresses abominably. And she's much too casual with all of
them&mdash;especially with Theo, even if she <i>did</i> save his life
from typhoid fever."</p>

<p>Honor made no immediate reply. It was only charitable to
suppose that an overdose of sunshine and block tea was
responsible for the note of irritation in Evelyn's tone.</p>

<p>"I suppose you think I ought to imitate her," Mrs Desmond
went on, after an expectant pause. "Kohat is hateful enough
in the cold weather, and with heat and cholera, and flies
added, it would kill me outright! Besides, I don't believe a
man loves one any better for that sort of thing in the end.
He probably gets horribly bored, and doesn't like to say so.
Besides&mdash;Theo <i>prefers</i> me to go, he <i>said</i> so; and that
settles everything quite comfortably for us both. By the
way, I've been planning a sort of introduction picnic for
you, only that stupid tea-party put it out of my head. I'll
make out a list of people at once and send the invitations
out this evening."</p>

<p>She crossed over to her bureau, which, apart from the piano,
was the only piece of furniture the room contained that in
England would be considered worthy of the name.</p>

<p>While she sat absorbed in her congenial task, Desmond
entered equipped for polo, and after a few words with Honor
went over to his wife.</p>

<p>"What are you so taken up with, Ladybird?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Something lovely! A picnic&mdash;for Honor."</p>

<p>Desmond laughed.</p>

<p>"Six for her and half a dozen for yourself! Let's see who
we're inviting."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>
<p>He ran his eye down the list of guests&mdash;twelve in all. At
sight of the last two names&mdash;Mr Kresney, Miss Kresney&mdash;he
frowned sharply, and taking up his wife's discarded pencil
ran a broad black line through both.</p>

<p>She pushed his hand aside with an unusual display of
irritation.</p>

<p>"What did you do <i>that</i> for?" she demanded, a ring of
defiance in her voice. "I want to ask the Kresneys; and I
will&mdash;all the same."</p>

<p>"Indeed, little woman, you'll do nothing of the sort."</p>

<p>"Why? What's wrong with them, Theo? They're quite decent
people, as far as I can see."</p>

<p>"Which doesn't prove that you can see very far! You must
just take my word for it, that whatever else they may be,
the Kresneys are not our sort at all."</p>

<p>"I suppose you really mean they're not up to <i>Frontier
Cavalry form!</i>" she retorted, not without a thrill of fear
at her own daring; for the pride of the Frontier Force is a
deeply-rooted pride; and, considering its records, not
unjustifiable after all.</p>

<p>Desmond's eyes flashed fire, and a sharp retort rose to his
lips. But, after a brief silence, he answered his wife with
a restraint that spoke volumes to the girl at the tea-table
behind him.</p>

<p>"Your taunt is unjust and untrue. In a general way we accept
most people for what they are, out here. But one has to draw
the line somewhere, even in India. If I were
Deputy-Commissioner, the Kresneys would be asked along with
the rest. But, in my position, I am free to make
distinctions. And I have very good reasons for not asking
Kresney to an informal picnic of my particular friends. On
neutral ground, such as the club, or the tennis-courts, I
have nothing to say; though I should naturally feel pleased
if you considered my wishes a little in this matter."</p>

<p>"Well, then, why can't you consider <i>mine</i> a little too? I
told Miss Kresney about it, and she's expecting to come."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for that; I don't want to hurt the girl's
feelings. But you can't take people up just for once and
ignore them afterwards. The truth is, they both see plainly
enough that you haven't quite got the hang of things out
here yet, and they are naturally taking full advantage of
the fact."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>
<p>Evelyn's passing gentleness evaporated on the instant.</p>

<p>"They're <i>not!</i>" she protested wrathfully. "And it's horrid
of you to say such things! They like me, I don't see why I
shouldn't be nice to them. Besides, this is <i>my</i> picnic&mdash;I
planned it&mdash;and if <i>I'm</i> the hostess I can ask who I
please." The touch of young importance that sounded through
the petulance of her tone dispelled the last shadow of
Desmond's annoyance and set him smiling.</p>

<p>"Why, of course, Ladybird&mdash;within reasonable limits. But
after all, the hospitality offered is mine; and what's more,
the hostess is mine into the bargain!"</p>

<p>He laid his hand lightly against the rose-flush of her
cheek, but she jerked it impatiently aside.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if you will take it that way," he said, in a tone
of resigned weariness, and turning abruptly on his heel came
across to Honor, whose cheeks were almost as hot as Evelyn's
own.</p>

<p>"I'm glad Alla Dad Khan made himself interesting this
afternoon," he remarked conversationally. "Ressaldar
Rajinder Singh, who commands my Sikh troop, is very anxious
to come and pay his respects some day soon. You see, as your
father's daughter and the Major's sister you are a rather
special person for us all. But I must be off now. The
fellows will be waiting. I'll arrange about the Sirdar
to-morrow."</p>

<p>On the threshold he paused and looked towards his wife, who
still sat with her back to the room, her head supported on
her hand.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Ladybird," he said, and there was marked
kindliness in his tone.</p>

<p>She acknowledged the words with a scarcely perceptible
movement, and a few minutes later the rattle of hoofs on the
road came sharply to their ears.</p>

<p>Honor's anger flamed up and overflowed.</p>

<p>"Oh, Evelyn, how <i>can</i> you behave like that to him!"</p>

<p>Still no answer; only, after a short silence, Evelyn rose
and faced her friend. Then Honor saw that her cheeks were
wet and her eyes brimming with tears.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<p>It is to be feared that her first sensation was one of pure
annoyance. Evelyn thoroughly deserved a scolding: and here
she was, as usual, disarming rebuke by her genuine distress.</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i>, I suppose he'll go&mdash;and get <i>killed!</i>" she said, in
a choked voice.</p>

<p>"My dear child, what nonsense! He'll come back safe enough.
You don't deserve that he should be so patient with you&mdash;you
don't indeed!"</p>

<p>Evelyn looked up at her with piteous drowned eyes, whose
expression had the effect of making Honor feel altogether in
the wrong.</p>

<p>"He shouldn't have made such disagreeable remarks about me
and the Kresneys, then," she said brokenly. "All the same, I
wanted to speak to him. But&mdash;I was crying, and I couldn't
make a scene&mdash;with <i>you</i> there. And now&mdash;if anything happens
to him, and&mdash;I never see him again,&mdash;it'll be all <i>your</i>
fault!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<p>With that finely illogical conclusion she swept out of the
room, leaving Honor serenely unimpressed by her own share in
the impending tragedy, yet not a little troubled at thought
of the man who, for the rest of his natural life, lay at the
mercy of such bewildering methods of reasoning.</p>

<h4>AN EXPURGATED EDITION.</h4>

<div class="blockpoem">

<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"A little lurking secret of the blood;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">A little serpent secret, rankling keen."</span><br />
<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Kresneys looked in vain for the coveted invitation, and
the trifling circumstance loomed largely on their narrow
horizon.</p>

<p>Owen Kresney possessed in a high degree that talent for
discovering or inventing slights which is pride of race run
crooked, and reveals the taint of mixed blood in a man's
veins. As District Superintendent of Police he had relieved
his predecessor in the middle of the hot weather. His sister
being at Mussoorie, he had arrived alone; and, in accordance
with the friendly spirit of the Frontier, had been made an
honorary member of the station Mess, where he had found
himself very much a stranger in a strange land.</p>

<p>The man's self-conceit was unlimited; his sense of humour
<i>nil</i>; and in less than a month he had been unanimously
voted a "<i>pukka</i><a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
 bounder" by that isolated community of Englishmen, who played as
hard as they worked, and invariably "played the game"; a code of
morals which had apparently been left out of Kresney's desultory
education. The fact revealed itself in a hundred infinitesimal ways,
and each revelation added a fresh stone to the wall that sprang up
apace between himself and his companions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<p>Among them all Desmond and Wyndham represented, in the
highest degree, those unattainable attributes which Kresney
was secretly disposed to envy; and his narrow soul solaced
itself by heartily detesting their possessors. This ability
to recognise the highest without the least desire to reach
it, breeds more than half the pangs of envy, hatred, and
malice that corrode the lesser natures of earth. But there
were also, in Kresney's case, personal and particular
reasons which served to nourish these microbes of the soul.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the hot weather the man's growing
unpopularity had been established by an incident at Mess,
which brought him into such sharp contact with Desmond as he
was not likely to forget.</p>

<p>There had been a very small party at dinner. Several of the
older men were absent on leave, and three were on the sick
list, no uncommon occurrence in Frontier stations. Thus it
had chanced that Desmond was the senior officer present.</p>

<p>The wine had already been round twice when the sound of a
lady's name, spoken in passing, had diverted Kresney's
attention from his own dissatisfied thoughts.</p>

<p>It chanced that he had met this same lady at Murree a year
ago, and that she had roundly snubbed his advances towards
intimacy. The unexpected mention of her name revived that
sense of injury which smoulders in such natures like a live
coal; and on the same instant awoke the desire to hit back
with the readiest weapon available.</p>

<p>Forgetful of the restriction imposed by the rigid code of
the mess-table, he launched the first disparaging comment
that sprang to his mind.</p>

<p>Directly the sentence was out, he could have bitten his own
tongue for pure vexation.</p>

<p>It fell crisp and clear into a chasm of silence, as a
dropped pebble plashes into a well.</p>

<p>The stillness lasted nearly a minute, and while it lasted
Kresney felt the fire of Desmond's glance through his
lowered lids. Then some one hazarded a remark, and the
incident was submerged in a renewed tide of talk.</p>

<p>When dinner broke up, with a general movement towards the
ante-room, Kresney became aware that Desmond was at his
side.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>
<p>"You will be good enough to come into the verandah with
me," he had said in a tone of command; and Kresney, feeling
ignominiously like a chidden schoolboy, had had no choice
but to obey.</p>

<p>Before that brief interview was ended, the man had heard the
truth about himself for the first time in his life, with the
sole result that he registered in his heart an unquenchable
hatred of the speaker.</p>

<p>But Desmond had been in no mood just then to reckon with
after-results. All the inborn chivalry of the man was up in
arms, less against the spoken words than against the petty
spite underlying them&mdash;the cowardly hit at a woman powerless
to defend herself. In an unguarded moment he gave full vent
to the scorn and disgust that consumed him, and lashed the
man without mercy.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;realising the utter inability to alter the other's
peculiar point of view&mdash;natural magnanimity checked his
impetuous outburst:</p>

<p>"I don't know whether you are aware," he said, "that after
to-night I should be justified in asking the Mess President
to remove your name from the list of Honorary Members. But
that is rather a strong measure, and I decided instead to
speak a few straight words to you myself. If they've been a
trifle too straight, I am sorry. But remarks of the kind you
made this evening are inadmissible at a mess-table; or, for
that matter, at any other table where&mdash;gentlemen are
present. Now, if you give me your word to keep the rules of
the Mess strictly in future, I will give you mine that this
incident shall never be mentioned to any one by me, or by
any one of the fellows here to-night."</p>

<p>Kresney had given the required promise none too graciously.
But his effort at perfunctory thanks stuck in his throat;
nor did Desmond appear to expect them. With a brief
reassurance in respect of his own silence he turned back
into the Mess; and there, so far as externals went, the
incident had ended.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>
<p>Yet, on this still March evening, as Kresney strolled back
and forth on his narrow verandah, enjoying an after-dinner
cigar, every detail of that detested interview darted across
his memory for the hundredth time, like a lightning-streak
across a cloud. Wounded, in the most susceptible part of his
nature, Kresney saw no reason to deny himself the
satisfaction of hitting back. Whatever may have been his
principles in regard to debts in general, he was
scrupulously punctilious in settling debts of
malice,&mdash;indirectly, if possible; and in this instance
personal antipathy added zest to the mere duty of repayment.</p>

<p>Very early in the cold weather Kresney had become aware that
an effective weapon lay ready to his hand, and had taken it
up without scruple or reluctance. Evelyn Desmond's natural
lack of discernment, her blindness to the subtle
impertinence of flattery, and her zeal for tennis&mdash;a game
seldom patronised by cavalrymen,&mdash;had worked all together
for good; and Kresney had gone forward accordingly, nothing
loth.</p>

<p>He had looked to the riding picnic to mark a definite step
in advance, and Mrs Desmond's intention of inviting them was
beyond doubt. Remained the inference that Desmond had used
either authority or persuasion to prevent it.</p>

<p>The idea stirred up all the dregs of the man's soul. A
sudden bitterness overwhelmed him&mdash;a sense of the futility
of attempting to strike at a man so obviously favoured by
the gods; a man who held his head so resolutely above the
minor trivialities of life.</p>

<p>But the will to strike would soon or late evolve a way.
There were other means of achieving intimacy with a woman as
inexperienced as little Mrs Desmond, and he would get Linda
to help him. Linda was a good girl, if a trifle stupid. At
least she had the merit of believing in him and obeying his
wishes with unquestioning fidelity&mdash;a very creditable merit
in the eyes of the average man.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<p>These reflections brought him to a standstill by one of the
doors that opened into the drawing-room. It was a long
narrow room of an aggressively Anglo-Indian
type&mdash;overcrowded with aimless tables, painted stools and
chairs in crumpled bazaar muslins, or glossy with Aspinall's
enamel. The dingy walls were peppered with Japanese fans,
China plates, liliputian brackets, and photographs in plush
frames. Had Miss Kresney taken her stand on each door-sill
in turn and flung her possessions, without aim or design, at
the whitewashed spaces around her, she could not have
produced a more admired disorder. This she recognised with a
thrill of pride; for she aspired to be artistic, and some
misguided friend had assured her that the one thing needful
was to avoid symmetry or regularity in any form.</p>

<p>Her own appearance harmonised admirably with her
surroundings. She wore the shapeless tea-gown beloved of her
kind&mdash;made in the verandah, and finished with dingy lace at
the neck and wrists, and even at this hour a suggestion of
straw slippers showed beneath the limp silk of her gown.
Yet, as Evelyn Desmond saw her on the tennis-courts, she was
a neatly clad, angular girl of eight-and-twenty, with a
suppressed, furtive air that was an unconscious reflection
upon her brother's character. In her heart she cherished a
lurking admiration for Desmond, and aspired to become the
wife of a cavalry officer&mdash;Harry Denvil being the temporary
hero of her dreams.</p>

<p>When her brother entered the room she was fitfully engaged
in perpetrating a crewel-work atrocity for one of her many
chairs.</p>

<p>He did not speak his thought at once, but stood looking down
at her critically through the smoke-wreaths of his cigar.
The major share of good looks certainly rested with himself;
but for eyes set too near together, and the relentless lines
that envy and ill-humour pencil about a man's mouth, the
face was attractive enough, in its limited fashion. He had
the same air of being "off duty" which pervaded his sister,
and his Japanese smoking-suit showed signs of being a very
old friend indeed.</p>

<p>"Look here, Linda," he began at last, "when are we playing
tennis again with little Mrs Desmond?"</p>

<p>"I think it was Tuesday," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, then, ask her to tea here first, d'you see?"</p>

<p>Linda's brown eyes&mdash;it pleased her to call them
hazel&mdash;widened with surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, my! D'you think she would reallee come? It was nastee
of her to leave us out of her picnic like that, after she
told me all about it, too."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>
<p>Miss Kresney's insistence on the consonants and the final
vowels was more marked than her brother's; for although
three-fourths of the blood in her veins was English, very
few of her intimate associates could make so proud a boast
without perjuring their souls: and there are few things more
infectious than tricks of speech.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," he acquiesced readily. "But I'm jolly well
certain that was not her doing. She'll come, right enough,
if you ask her nicely. At all events it is worth trying, if
only on the chance of annoying her insufferable husband."</p>

<p>"If you wish it, certainlee. I would like to be better
friends with Mrs Desmond. Only, I do not quite see why you
dislike <i>him</i> so much more than the others."</p>

<p>Kresney hesitated before replying. It was not often that
Linda aspired to question either his motives or decisions;
and he had begun to suspect that her loyalty wavered, by a
hair's-breadth, where Desmond was concerned. After all, why
not tell her an expurgated edition of the truth. The idea
commended itself to him for many reasons, and even as she
was beginning to wonder at his silence he sat down beside
her and spoke; the sting of humiliation stimulating his
inventive faculty as he went on.</p>

<p>Desmond himself would scarce have recognised the incident,
but Miss Kresney was clearly impressed.</p>

<p>"You see, Linda," her brother concluded, "a fellow can't be
expected to stand that sort of thing without hitting back,
and I am trying to hit back a bit now. It is only fair.
These Frontier Force chaps need a lot of setting down, I can
tell you. They fancy they hold all India in their hands. And
what is it they do after all, except play polo like maniacs,
and play all manner of foolish pranks at Mess? They make a
god out of this Desmond, here; and the fellow is as proud as
the devil. He will be jolly well mad if his wife gets really
friendly with me. As he will not ask us there, we will ask
her here&mdash;you see? And you must be as nice as you can. Say
pretty things to her&mdash;that pleases her more than anything:
and make yourself useful, if you get the chance. She's not
half a bad little woman; and if you help me, Linda, I shall
get in with her yet in spite of her conceited prig of a
husband."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>
<p>The smile that accompanied the words was not a pleasant
one, but the girl returned it with an uncritical fervour of
affection.</p>

<p>"You know I am always glad to please you, Owen. I am onlee
sorree you did not tell me all about it sooner."</p>

<p>Her ready championship put him in high good-humour with
himself and the world at large.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>
<p>"You really <i>are</i> no end of a good girl, Linda," he said,
as he rose to his feet. "I shall ask Denvil to tea for you
on Tuesday; and you shall have a new frock as soon as ever I
get next month's pay. Not a thing made in the verandah; but
a good style of frock from Mussoorie or Lahore, whichever
you please; and you can ask Mrs Desmond to help you choose
it. Her dresses are always first class, and she is
interested in such things."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn Desmond's</span> picnic was an accomplished fact. At four
o'clock, in the full glare of a late March sun, a
business-like detachment of twenty horses, and one
disdainful camel, proceeded at a brisk trot along the
lifeless desolation of the Bunnoo Road. The party kept in
close formation, straggling of any sort being inadmissible
when the bounds of the station have been left behind. Ten of
the riders were English, and an armed escort guarded them in
front and rear; the camel, in gala trappings of red and
blue, being responsible for provisions, enamelled iron
tea-things, and the men's guns.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the absence of the Kresneys, Evelyn Desmond
was in a mood of unusual effervescence. Harry Denvil rode at
her side, and the two kept up a perpetual flow of such
aimless, happy nonsense as is apt to engender vague regret
in the hearts of those who have arrived at greater wisdom.</p>

<p>Three miles of riding brought them to the welcome
refreshment of a river running crystal clear over a bed of
pebbles. Beside the river rose an isolated plateau&mdash;abrupt,
inconsequent, and, like all things else in the tawny
landscape, unsoftened by a blade of living green.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>
<p>The face of the rock was riddled with rough, irregular
holes, as though Titans had been using it for a target.
Around and above it a bevy of blue rock-pigeons&mdash;circling,
dipping, and darting with a strong rush of wings&mdash;shone like
iridescent jewels, green and blue and grey, against the
unstained turquoise of the sky, whose intensity of colour
made generous atonement for the lack of it on earth. At the
foot of the cliff a deep pool mirrored the calm wonder of
the sky.</p>

<p>Here the camel was brought to his knees, and the escort,
dismounting, formed a wide circle of sentries round the
little party, the undernote of danger suggested by their
presence giving a distinct flavour to the childishly simple
affair. The white man's craze for carrying his food many
miles from home, in order to eat it on the ground, remains a
perpetual bewilderment to the natives, who express their
opinion on the matter in all frankness and simplicity by
christening it the "dinner of fools."</p>

<p>Pigeon-shooting was the established amusement of afternoons
spent under the cliff; and, the meal being over, sport was
soon in full progress, Frank Olliver and Mrs Jim Conolly
handling their guns as skilfully as any man present.</p>

<p>While Honor stood watching them, Wyndham drew near and
remained by her for a few seconds without a word. Then:
"Shall we go and sit over by the river, Miss Meredith, and
leave them to their sport?" he asked suddenly, his eyes and
voice more urgent than he knew.</p>

<p>"Yes; I'd far rather watch the birds than shoot them. They
are too beautiful to be killed for the sake of passing the
time. But you probably don't see it that way&mdash;men seldom
do."</p>

<p>"I must be the eternal exception, then!" he answered, as
they turned away. "It's not a creditable confession for a
right-minded man: but I shrink from taking life, even in the
exigencies of my profession."</p>

<p>At that she turned upon him with a spontaneous frankness of
interest, which had lured many men to their undoing.</p>

<p>"Will you think me very ill-mannered if I ask how you ever
came to choose such a profession at all? I wondered about it
the first time I saw you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>
<p>"Do I look as hopelessly unsoldier-like as all <i>that?</i>"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;a thousand times, no!" And the quick colour flamed in
her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Well, then?"</p>

<p>"I only meant&mdash;I see a good deal in faces, and&mdash;yours gave
me a strong impression that you would prefer reading and
thinking to acting and striving."</p>

<p>His smile had in it both surprise and satisfaction.</p>

<p>"You were not far out there. Let us sit down on this rock
for a bit. I would like to answer your question. May I light
a cigarette?"</p>

<p>"Do."</p>

<p>He took his time over the simple operation. His impulse
towards unreserve puzzled him, and several seconds of
silence passed before he spoke again; silence, emphasised by
broken snatches of talk and laughter; by the sharp crack of
guns; and the whirring of a hundred wings, like the restless
murmuring in the heart of a shell.</p>

<p>"It may sound strange to you," he began, not without an
effort, "but the truth is that my choice of a profession was
simply the result of my friendship with Desmond. I think I
told you we were at school together. <i>His</i> future was a
foregone conclusion, and when it came to the point&mdash;I chose
just to throw in my lot with his. I am quite aware that many
people thought me a fool. But we have had twelve years of it
together here, he and I; and it has certainly been good
enough for me."</p>

<p>He spoke in a tone of great quietness, his eyes set upon the
shining reaches of the river which, by now, ran molten gold
in the westering sunlight.</p>

<p>"Thank you for telling me," she said; and the simple words
set his pulses travelling at an unreasonable rate of speed.
"I had no idea friendship could ever mean quite so much."</p>

<p>"It doesn't in nine cases out of ten. But I think that's
enough about myself. It isn't my habit to entertain ladies
with egotistical monologues!"</p>

<p>"But then, properly behaved ladies don't ask you direct
personal questions, do they?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well&mdash;no&mdash;not often."</p>

<p>And they exchanged one of those smiles that ripen intimacy
more speedily than a month of talk.</p>

<p>"I'm quite unrepentant, all the same!" she said. "And I'm
rather wanting to ask you another. It's about Captain
Desmond this time. May I?"</p>

<p>"Ask away!"</p>

<p>"Well, I want to know more of how he won his V.C. Evelyn
could give me no details when I asked her; and it struck me
just now that you were probably there at the time."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, I <i>was</i>," he said, with a new ring in his
voice. "There were a few bad minutes when we in the valley
felt morally certain we had seen the last of him."</p>

<p>She turned on him with kindling eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, tell me&mdash;please! Tell me everything. I am soldier
enough to understand."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>
<p>"I verily believe you are! And, since you wish it, you
shall have it in full. It happened during a rising of the
Ghilzais six years ago. They had given us rather a stiff
time of it for some weeks, and on this occasion a strong
body of them had to be dislodged from a height where they
were safely entrenched behind one of their stone sangars,
ready to pick off any of us who should attempt the ascent.
But the thing had to be done, like many other
hopeless-looking things, and a party of infantry and cavalry
were detailed for the duty,&mdash;a company of Sikhs, and
twenty-five dismounted men of Desmond's squadron, led by
himself. Our main force was stationed in the valley, you
understand, and the advance was covered by three mountain
guns. The men were deployed in an extended line at the foot
of the hill, and began a careful ascent, taking advantage of
every scrap of cover available, the Ghilzais picking them
off with deadly certainty whenever they got the smallest
chance. About two-thirds of the way up Alla Dad Khan was
bowled over and lay out in the open dangerously wounded,
under the full brunt of the enemy's fire. In a flash Desmond
was out from under the rock he had just reached. He crossed
that open space under a rain of bullets it made one sick to
see, and got the poor fellow up in his arms. It seemed a
sheer impossibility for him to get back under cover alive,
hampered as he was by the wounded man, who&mdash;as you know&mdash;is
a much bigger fellow than himself. I gave up every shred of
hope as I watched, and one or two of the sowars near me
broke down and cried like children. But if ever I beheld a
miracle it was during those few astounding minutes&mdash;the
worst I've ever known. His clothes were riddled with
bullets; two of them passed clean through his helmet; yet
except for a flesh wound in the left arm, he was untouched."</p>

<p>Wyndham paused, and the girl drew in a long breath.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can see it all!" she said softly. "But isn't there
more?"</p>

<p>"A little more, if you want it."</p>

<p>"Please."</p>

<p>"Well, the hill was successfully cleared, and you may
imagine the welcome we gave Theo, when at last he got back
to camp, with his uniform in ribbons and his helmet gone. I
don't know when I've heard such cheering from natives.
Besides saving the Jemadar, the success of the whole affair
had been due to his leadership and example. He wouldn't hear
of it, of course; but when the account came out in the
'Gazette,' he found himself belauded from start to finish,
with a V.C. conferred on him to crown all. One couldn't say
much to him even then. He's not the sort."</p>

<p>Honor's cheeks were on fire, her eyes like stars; and it is
characteristic of Paul Wyndham that he noted these facts
without a shadow of envy.</p>

<p>"The genuine modesty of genius," she said; and Paul bent his
head in acquiescence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>
<p>"Theo's genius is of the best kind," he added; "it is
genius of character, of a wide sympathetic understanding of
men and things. And on the Frontier, Miss Meredith, that
sort of understanding counts for more than anywhere else in
the country. We control our fellows here as much by love and
respect as by mere discipline. Get a native to love you, and
believe in you, and you are sure of him for good. That is
why officers like Theo and your brother, who hold their
men's hearts in their hands, are, without exaggeration, the
pillars on which the safety of India rests. It is when the
cry of 'Jehad' runs like fire along the Border, and the
fidelity of our troops is being tampered with, that we get
the clearest proof of this. At such times pay, pension, and
Orders of Merit have no more power to restrain a Pathan than
a thread of cotton round his ankle. But there's just one
thing he will <i>not</i> do&mdash;he will not desert, in his hour of
need, an officer whom he has found to be just, upright, and
fearless, and whom he has praised as a hero to his own
people."</p>

<p>Wyndham's unwonted eloquence, and the glow of feeling
underlying it, lifted the girl to fresh heights of
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Oh, how glad I am to have come here!" she said with sudden
fervour. "Captain Desmond was talking in much the same
strain just before we started; and one cannot listen to him
without catching the fire of his enthusiasm, which is surely
the best kind of fire that ever came down from heaven!"</p>

<p>Just as she finished speaking, Desmond himself strode up to
them.</p>

<p>"I say, Paul, old man," he remonstrated, "isn't it some one
else's turn for an innings by this time? Mrs Conolly is keen
to have a talk with Miss Meredith before we start. You both
looked so absorbed that she begged me not to interrupt! I
ought to have introduced her to you before starting, Miss
Meredith. She's the wife of our acting Civil Surgeon and
quite an old friend of yours, it seems. Will you come?"</p>

<p>The girl rose and turned to Wyndham with a friendly smile.
"You and I can have our talk out another time, can't we?"</p>

<p>"By all means."</p>

<p>He sat watching her as she left him, with a tender
concentration of gaze, his brain stunned by a glimpse into
undreamed-of possibilities; into a region of life whereof he
knew nothing, and had believed himself content to know
nothing all his days.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<p>Mrs Jim Conolly was a large woman, nearer forty than
thirty. Twenty years of India, of hot weathers resolutely
endured, of stretching small means to the utmost limit and
beyond it, had left their mark, in sallowness of skin, in
broken lines of thought between her brows, and of restrained
endurance about her firmly-closed lips. She had the air of a
woman who has never allowed herself to be worsted by the
minor miseries of life; and in India the minor miseries
multiply exceedingly. Unthinking observers stigmatised her
face as harsh and unprepossessing; but it was softened and
illumined by a glow of genuine welcome as she greeted Honor
Meredith.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you have the smallest recollection of me?" she
said. "My last glimpse of you was in a dak gharri at Pindi,
when you were first starting for home nineteen years ago,
and the sight of what you have grown into makes me feel a
very old woman indeed! Do you remember those Pindi days at
all?"</p>

<p>"Bits, here and there, quite vividly. I had been wondering
already why I seemed to know your face. It was you who had
the two nice babies I loved so dearly. Haven't you any for
me to play with now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my two youngest are still with me. But they are rather
big babies by this time. You must come over and see them
soon, and we will pick up the threads of our dropped
friendship, Honor. Your father and mother were very good to
me in the old days, but you were my chief friend from the
start. You have grown into a very beautiful woman, dear,"
she added, in a lower tone; "and if you ever want help or
advice while you are here alone, I hope you will turn to me
for it as readily as you would to your own mother. I haven't
seen Lady Meredith for years. Sit down under the cliff with
me, and give me some news of them all."</p>

<p>By the time dusk had set in the little party was back again
in Desmond's compound, the escort deserting them at the
gate; and as Honor Meredith prepared to dismount, Paul
Wyndham came forward, a certain restrained eagerness in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"May I?" he asked, with the diffidence of a man unused to
making such requests.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>
<p>"I generally manage all right, thanks."</p>

<p>"You might make an exception, though&mdash;just this once."</p>

<p>For an instant of time his hands supported her&mdash;an instant
of such keen sensation that, when it was passed, he pulled
himself up sharply&mdash;called himself a fool, and in the same
breath wished that she had been a few degrees less skilful
in springing lightly to the ground.</p>

<p>Ready-made talk was, for the moment, beyond him; and he
departed something hastily, leaving Honor and his friend
alone together in the darkening verandah.</p>

<p>Voices and laughter came out to them from the drawing-room,
where Evelyn and Denvil were carrying on their young
foolishness with undiminished zeal; and Desmond turned upon
the girl the irresistible friendliness of his eyes.</p>

<p>"You enjoyed yourself, I hope,&mdash;Miss Meredith?"</p>

<p>"Immensely, thank you,&mdash;Captain Desmond."</p>

<p>Her tone was a deliberate echo of his; and their eyes met in
mutual laughter.</p>

<p>"Aren't we good friends enough now to drop the formality?"
he asked. And at the question a lightning vision came to her
of the scene on the hillside, so vividly described by his
friend.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I think&mdash;we are," she said slowly.</p>

<p>"That's right. I think so too."</p>

<p>"I seem to have made quite an advance in that direction this
afternoon," she added, in no little surprise at her own
boldness.</p>

<p>"How's that? Paul?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh! so that was the engrossing subject. I might have known
Paul wasn't likely to be expatiating on himself."</p>

<p>"He gave me a stirring account of a certain day in October,
six years ago," she went on, with an unconscious softening
of her voice.</p>

<p>Desmond's short laugh had in it a genuine touch of
embarrassment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>
<p>"Did he? That was superfluous of him. The good fellow would
have done no less himself in the circumstances. Listen to
those two children in there! How finely they're enjoying
themselves! I say, Harry!" he shouted to the invisible
Denvil, who came forth straightway;&mdash;a squarely built,
chestnut-haired boy, his sea-blue eyes still full of
laughter; "have you quite decided to invite yourself to
dinner?"</p>

<p>"<i>Rather</i>&mdash;if you'll have me?"</p>

<p>"Of course I'll have you. Cut away and make yourself
respectable."</p>

<p>And as the boy vanished in the darkness Desmond turned to
find his wife's figure in the open doorway, its purity of
outline thrown into strong relief by the light within.</p>

<p>She stood on the threshold balancing herself on the tips of
her toes in a light-hearted ecstasy of unrest, and flung out
both hands towards her husband.</p>

<p>"Oh, Theo, it was delicious! I had lovely fun!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>
<p>She came and nestled close to him with the confiding
simplicity of a child; and Honor, under cover of the dusk,
slipped round by the back of the house to her own room.</p>

<h4>BRIGHT EYES OF DANGER.</h4>

<div class="blockpoem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"My mistress still, the open road;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">And the bright eyes of danger."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 21em;">&mdash;R. L. S.</span><br />
<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> mid-April, life in the blue bungalow had undergone an
unmistakable change for the better; and Theo Desmond,
sitting alone in the congenial quietness of his study, an
after-dinner pipe between his teeth, a volume of Persian
open before him, and Rob's slumbering body pressed close
against his ankles, told himself that he and his wife, in
befriending Honor Meredith at a moment of difficulty, had
without question entertained an angel unawares. Evelyn had
blossomed visibly in the pleasure of her companionship;
while he himself found her good to talk with, and undeniably
good to look at.</p>

<p>There was also a third point in her favour, and that by no
means the least. Her sympathetic rendering of the great
masters of music had renewed a pleasure linked with memories
sacred beyond all others. Althea Desmond bid fair to retain
undivided supremacy over the strong son, who had been the
crown and glory of her life. Death itself seemed powerless
to affect their essential unity. Her spirit&mdash;vivid and
vigorous as his own&mdash;still shared and dominated his every
thought; and her photograph, set in a silver frame of
massive simplicity, stood close at his elbow, while he
reviewed the changes wrought in the past few weeks by the
unobtrusive influence of John Meredith's sister.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>
<p>The mere lessening of strain and friction in regard to the
countless details of an Indian household was, in itself, an
unspeakable relief. During the first few months of his
marriage he had persevered steadily in the thankless task of
instructing his cheerfully incompetent bride in the language
and household mysteries of her adopted country. But the more
patiently he helped her the more she leaned upon his help;
till the futility of his task had threatened to wear his
temper threadbare, and to put a severe strain on a
relationship more complex than he had imagined possible.</p>

<p>Now, however, the tyranny of trifles was overpast. The man's
elastic nature righted itself, with the spring of a
finely-tempered blade released from pressure, and as the
passing weeks revealed his wife's progress under Honor's
tuition, he readily attributed her earlier failures to his
own lack of skill.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, her power to cope with Amar
Singh&mdash;Desmond's devoted Hindu bearer&mdash;and the eternal
enigmas of charcoal, <i>jharrons</i>,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and the <i>dhobie</i>,
<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
had not increased one whit: and she knew it. But the welcome
sound of praise from her husband's lips convinced her that
she must have done something to deserve it. She accepted it,
therefore, in all complacency, without any acknowledgment of
the guiding hand upon the reins.</p>

<p>Great peace dwelt also in the compound, where a colony of
servants and their families lived their unknown lives apart;
and great pride in the heart of Parbutti, since Amar Singh
had so far unbent as to prophesy that the Miss Sahib would
without doubt become a Burra Mem before the end of her days.</p>

<p>While Desmond sat alone in this warm April evening, studying
the fantastic Persian characters with something less than
his wonted concentration, the sound of the piano came to him
through the half-open door.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>
<p>For a few moments he listened, motionless, to the first
weird whispering bars of Grieg's Folkscene, "Auf den
Bergen," then the book was pushed hastily aside and the lamp
blown out. Rob&mdash;rudely awakened from a delectable dream of
cats and the naked calves of unsuspecting coolies&mdash;found
himself plunged in darkness, and his master vanishing
through the curtains into the detested drawing-room.</p>

<p>Evelyn was installed on the fender-stool of dull red velvet,
her hands clasped about her knees, her head raised in
expectation. A dress of softly flowing white silk, and a
single row of pearls at her throat, intensified her fragile
freshness, as of a lily of the field, a creature out of
touch with the sterner elements of life. It was at such
moments that her husband was apt to suffer a contraction of
heart, lest, in an impulse of infatuation, he had undertaken
more than he would be able to perform.</p>

<p>She patted his favourite chair; then, impulsively deserting
her seat, crouched on the hearth-rug beside him and nestled
her head against his knee.</p>

<p>"I told her to play it! I knew it would bring you at once,"
she whispered, caressing him lightly with a long slim hand.</p>

<p>"You shall sing to me afterwards yourself," he said, "a song
in keeping with your appearance to-night. You look like some
sort of elf-maiden in that simple gown and my pearls. Only
one touch wanted to complete the effect!"</p>

<p>With smiling deliberation he drew out four tortoise-shell
pins that upheld the silken lightness of her hair, so that
it fell in a fair soft cloud about her neck and shoulders.</p>

<p>"Theo! How dare you!"</p>

<p>And as she turned her face up to him, in laughing
remonstrance, he was struck anew by the childishness of its
contour, in spite of the pallor, which had become almost
habitual of late. Taking it between his hands he looked
steadfastly into the limpid shallows of her eyes, as though
searching for a hidden something which he had little hope to
find.</p>

<p>"Ladybird, what a baby you are still!" he murmured, "I
wonder <i>when</i> you mean to grow into a woman?"</p>

<p>Then with a start he became aware that Amar Singh, having
entered noiselessly through the door behind him, stood at
his side in a pose of imperturbable reverence and dignity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>
<p>"Olliver Memsahib <i>ghora per argya</i>,"
<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> he announced with
discreetly lowered lids; while Evelyn, springing up with
rose-petal cheeks and a small sound of dismay, must needs
try and look as if ladies in evening dress habitually wore
their hair hanging loose about their shoulders.</p>

<p>Honor swung round upon the music-stool as Frank Olliver, in
evening skirt and light drill jacket strode into the room.</p>

<p>Before she could bring out her news, a blare of trumpets,
sounding the alarm, startled the quiet of the night, and
Desmond leapt to his feet.</p>

<p>"There you are, Theo, man," she said. "You can hear for
yourself. It's a fire in the Lines. Geoff and I caught sight
of the flare just now from our back verandah. He's gone on
ahead; but I said I'd look in here for you."</p>

<p>"Thanks. Tell 'em to saddle the Demon, will you? I'll be
ready in two minutes."</p>

<p>And Mrs Olliver vanished from the room.</p>

<p>As Desmond prepared to follow her, his wife's fingers closed
firmly on the edge of his dinner-jacket.</p>

<p>She was sitting now in the chair he had left; and turned up
to him a face half beseeching, half resentful in its frame
of soft hair.</p>

<p>"Why must <i>you</i> go, Theo? There are heaps of others
who&mdash;aren't married."</p>

<p>"Don't be a little fool, child!" he broke out in spite of
himself. Then gently, decisively, he disengaged her fingers
from his coat; but their clinging grasp checked his
impatience to be gone.</p>

<p>He bent down, and spoke in a softened tone. "I've no time
for arguments, Evelyn. I am simply doing my duty."</p>

<p>He was gone&mdash;and she remained as he had left her, with hands
lying listlessly in her lap, and a frown between her finely
pencilled brows,&mdash;mollified, but by no means convinced.</p>

<p>Honor had hurried into the hall, where Frank Olliver greeted
her with impulsive invitation.</p>

<p>"Why don't you 'boot and saddle' too, Honor, an' ride along
with us?"</p>

<p>"I only wish I could! I'd love to go! But I <i>must</i> stay with
Evelyn. She is upset and nervous about Theo as it is."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>
<p>"Saints alive! How <i>can</i> you put up with her at all&mdash;at
all!" muttered irrepressible Frank. "But hush, now, here's
the blessed fellow himself!"</p>

<p>Theo Desmond strode rapidly down the square hall, hung with
trophies of the chase and implements of war&mdash;an incongruous
figure enough, in forage cap and long brown boots with
gleaming spurs, his sword buckled on over his evening
clothes. He snatched a long clasp-knife from the wall in
passing, and the Irishwoman, with an nod of approval,
hurried out into the verandah, where the impatient horses
could be heard champing their bits.</p>

<p>Desmond had a friendly smile for Honor in passing.</p>

<p>"Pity you can't come too. Be good to Ladybird. Don't let her
work herself into a fever about nothing."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>For eight breathless minutes the grey and the dun sped
through the warm night air, under a rising moon, their
shadows fleeing before them, long and black,&mdash;two perspiring
saïses following zealously in their wake;&mdash;till their riders
drew rein before a pandemonium of scurrying men and horses,
silhouetted against a background of fire.</p>

<p>The great pile of sun-dried bedding burnt merrily: sending
up fierce tongues of flame, that shamed the moonlight, as
dawn shames the lamp. A brisk wind from the hills caught up
shreds and flakes from the burning mass, driving them hither
and thither, to the sore distraction of man and beast.</p>

<p>Lithe forms of grass-cutters and water-carriers, in the
scantiest remnants of clothing, leaped and pranced on the
outskirts of the fire, like demons in a realistic hell.</p>

<p>In valiant spurts and jerks, alternating with ignominious
flight, they were combating that column of flame and smoke
with thimblefuls of water, flung out of stable buckets, or
squirted from mussacks. They were beating it also with
stript branches, making night radiant with a thousand
sparks.</p>

<p>But the soaring flames jeered at their pigmy efforts;
twinkled derisively on their glistening bodies; and assailed
the vast composure of the skies with leaping blades of
light.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>
<p>To the bewildering confusion of movement was added a no
less bewildering tumult of sound, whose most heart-piercing
note was the maddened scream of horses; and whose lesser
elements included shouts of officers and sowars;
high-pitched lamentations from the audience of natives; the
barking of dogs; and the drumming of a hundred hoofs upon
the iron-hard ground.</p>

<p>During the first alarm of the fire, which had broken out
perilously close to the quarters occupied by Desmond's
squadron, the terrified animals in their frenzied efforts to
break away from the ropes, had reduced the Lines to a state
of chaos. Those of them, and they were many, who succeeded
in wrenching out their pegs, had instinctively headed for
the parade-ground beyond the huts; their flight complicated
by wandering lengths of rope that trailed behind them,
whirled in mid-air, or imprisoned their legs in treacherous
coils; while sowars and officers risked life and limb in
attempting to free them from their dilemma.</p>

<p>The restless brilliance gave to all things a strange
nightmare grotesqueness: and a blinding, stifling shroud of
smoke whirled and billowed over all.</p>

<p>As the riders drew up, there was a momentary lull, and
before dismounting Desmond flung a ringing shout across the
stillness.</p>

<p>"<i>Shahbash</i>,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> men, <i>shahbash</i>
! Have no fear! Give more
water&mdash;water without ceasing!"</p>

<p>He was answered by an acclamation of welcome from all ranks.</p>

<p>"<i>Wah!</i> <i>Wah!</i> Desmin Sahib <i>argya</i>!"
<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> the sowars of his
squadron called to one another through the curling smoke;
and the new arrivals were speedily surrounded by a little
crowd of officers and men: Wyndham, Denvil, Alla Dad Khan,
and Ressaldar Rajinder Singh, in the spotless tunic and vast
silken turban of private life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>
<p>The Jemadar took possession of the Demon's bridle, and
Desmond, leaping lightly to the ground, hurried straightway
to the relief of a distressed grass-cut. The man had been
rash enough to attempt the capture of two horses at once,
and now stood in imminent danger of being kicked to death by
his ungrateful charges.</p>

<p>Desmond took both horses in hand, holding them at arm's
length, and soothing them with his voice alone.</p>

<p>"Here you are, Harry!" he said, as Denvil came to his
assistance. "This poor fellow will go with you now, quietly
enough."</p>

<p>Handing over his second horse to the grass-cut, he vanished
into the darkness; where, betwixt stampeding horses and the
incredible swiftness of fire, he found more than sufficient
scope for action.</p>

<p>He came to a standstill, at length, for a second's breathing
space;&mdash;and lo, Rajinder Singh emerging suddenly from the
heart of pandemonium, breathless with haste, a great
distress in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Ressaldar!" Desmond exclaimed. "What's up now?"</p>

<p>The tall Sikh saluted.</p>

<p>"The knife, Sahib! Give me your knife! It is <i>Sher Dil</i>,
<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
fallen amongst his ropes. He is like to strangle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Great Scott! I'll see to it myself."</p>

<p>And he set out, full speed, Rajinder Singh after him,
protesting at every step.</p>

<p>The great black charger, the glory of the squadron and of
his owner's heart, was in a perilous case. So securely had
he entangled himself in the head-rope that, despite the
freedom of his heels, and spasmodic efforts to regain his
feet, he remained pinned to earth, not many yards from where
the fire was raging,&mdash;his fear and misery increased by
wind-blown fragments of lighted straw, by the roar and
crackle of the burning pile.</p>

<p>Desmond saw at a glance that his rescue might prove a
dangerous business, but Rajinder Singh was beside him now,
still hopeful of turning him from his purpose.</p>

<p>"Hazúr&mdash;consider&mdash;the horse is mine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No more words!" Desmond broke in sharply. "Stay where you
are!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>
<p>He plunged forthwith into the stinging, blinding smoke;
dexterously avoiding the hoofs of Sher Dil, subduing his
terror with hand and voice, though himself half choked, and
constantly forced to close his eyes at the most critical
moments; while the task of avoiding the burning fragments
that fell about him seemed in itself to demand undivided
attention.</p>

<p>Rajinder Singh, stationed at the nearest possible point,
anxiously watched his Captain's progress; and here Paul
Wyndham joined him hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" he asked. "The Captain Sahib?"</p>

<p>"To my shame, your honour speaks truth," the old man made
answer humbly. "His heart was set to do this thing
himself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have no fear," Wyndham reassured him kindly; and, with a
sharp contraction of heart, ran to his friend's assistance.</p>

<p>Desmond had already stooped to slit the rope that pressed so
cruelly against the charger's throat; and, as Wyndham
reached him, the animal gave a last convulsive plunge; threw
out his forelegs in an ecstasy of freedom; and struck his
deliverer full on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Damnation!" Desmond muttered, as he fell to the ground, and
Sher Dil staggered, panting, to his feet.</p>

<p>Rajinder Singh sprang forward with a smothered cry. But,
quick as lightning, Desmond was up again, and had secured
the morsel of rope dangling by the horse's head. Only his
left arm hung limp and helpless, the droop of the shoulder
telling its own tale.</p>

<p>"Collar-bone," he said laconically, in reply to the mute
anxiety of Paul's face. "Same old spot again!"</p>

<p>"It might just as well have been&mdash;your head," Paul answered,
with a twist of his sensitive mouth. He had not quite got
over his few moments of acute suspense.</p>

<p>Desmond laughed.</p>

<p>"So it might, you old pessimist! But it wasn't! Here you
are, Ressaldar Sahib! Never have I seen a horse so set on
killing himself. But it was needful to disappoint him on
your account."</p>

<p>Rajinder Singh, who had come forward, plucking the muslin
scarf from his shoulders for a bandage, saluted in
acknowledgment of the words.</p>

<p>"How is it possible to make thanks, Hazúr...?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>Desmond laid a hand on the man's shoulder.</p>

<p>"No need of thanks," said he. "This fine fellow hath already
thanked me in his own rough fashion, clapping me on the
shoulder,&mdash;forgetful of his great strength,&mdash;because he had
no power to say 'Shahbash!'"</p>

<p>The old Sikh shook his head slowly, a great tenderness in
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Such is the gracious heart of the Captain Sahib, putting a
good face even upon that which is evil. Permit, at least,
that we make some manner of bandage till it be possible to
find the Doctor Sahib."</p>

<p>It was permitted; and the useless arm having been strapped
into place, Wyndham insisted upon his friend's departure; a
fiat against which Desmond's impetuous protests were
launched in vain. For, like many men of habitually gentle
bearing, Paul Wyndham's firmness was apt to be singularly
effective on the rare occasions when he thought it worth
while to give proof of its existence.</p>

<p>"I'll ride back with you myself," he announced, in a tone of
finality, "and go on to the Mess for Mackay afterwards. The
worst is over now, and you'll only let yourself in for a
demonstration if your men find out that any harm has come to
you." The diplomatic suggestion had the desired effect; and
they rode leisurely back to the bungalow, under a moon no
longer robbed of its radiance.</p>

<p>Few words passed between them as they went; but on arriving
at the squat, blue gate-posts Wyndham drew rein and spoke.</p>

<p>"Good-night, dear old chap. Take a stiff 'peg' the minute
you get in. I'm in need of one myself."</p>

<p>"Sorry if I gave you a bit of a shock, old man," Desmond
answered smiling, and rode at a foot's pace toward the
house.</p>

<p>"Here I am, Ladybird!" he announced, on entering the
drawing-room; and Evelyn, springing from the depths of his
chair, made an eager movement towards him.</p>

<p>But at sight of his bandaged arm and damp dishevelled
appearance she halted with lips apart. A curious coldness
crept into her eyes and entirely banished the young look
from her face.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>
<p>"Theo&mdash;you're hurt&mdash;you've broken something."</p>

<p>"Well, and if I have?" he answered laughing. "It's a mere
nothing. Only a collar-bone."</p>

<p>"Your collar-bone isn't nothing. And I can't <i>bear</i> to see
you all hideous and bandaged up like that. I knew something
would happen! I was sure it would!"</p>

<p>The light of good-humour faded from his eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, well, if you knew it all beforehand, no need to make
so many words about it now. Let me sit down. It's been
stifling work and&mdash;I'm tired."</p>

<p>He sank into the chair and closed his eyes, his face grown
suddenly weary. His wife drew near to him slowly, with more
of pained curiosity than of solicitude in her face, and laid
a half-reluctant hand on the arm of his chair.</p>

<p>"Does it hurt, Theo?" she asked softly.</p>

<p>"Nothing to bother about. Mackay will be here soon."</p>

<p>"Won't you tell us how it happened?"</p>

<p>"There's not much to tell, Ladybird. Rajinder Singh's
charger kicked me while I was cutting his head-rope&mdash;that's
all. The good old chap was quite upset because I wouldn't
let him do it himself."</p>

<p>"Well, I think you <i>ought</i> to have let him. It wouldn't have
mattered half so much if <i>he</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's enough, Evelyn!" the man broke out in a flash of
genuine anger. "If you're only going to say things of that
sort, you may as well hold your tongue."</p>

<p>And once again he closed his eyes, as if in self-defence
against further argument or upbraiding.</p>

<p>His wife stood watching him with a puzzled frown, while
Honor, a keenly interested observer, wondered what would
happen next.</p>

<p>Her sympathy, as always, inclined to the man's point of
view. But a passionate justness, very rare in women, forced
her to acknowledge that Evelyn's remonstrance, if
injudicious, was not unjustifiable. The girl saw clearly
that the sheer love of danger for its own sake, which
Frontier life breeds in men of daring spirit, had impelled
Desmond to needless and inconsiderate risk; saw also that
his own perception of the fact added fire to his sharp
retort.</p>

<p>He stirred at length, with an uneasy shifting of the damaged
shoulder.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<p>"This bandage is hideously uncomfortable," he said in a
changed tone. "Could you manage to untie it and fix it up
more firmly till Mackay comes?"</p>

<p>Thus directly appealed to, Evelyn cast a nervous glance at
Honor. The girl made neither sign nor movement, though her
hands ached to relieve the discomfort of the wounded man;
and after a perceptible moment of hesitation, Evelyn went to
Desmond's side, her heart fluttering like the heart of a
prisoned bird.</p>

<p>With tremulous fingers she unfastened the knot behind his
shoulder, and, having done so, rested her hand inadvertently
on the broken bone. It yielded beneath her touch, and she
dropped the end of the bandage with a little cry.</p>

<p>"Oh, Theo, it <i>moved</i>! I can't touch it again! It's ... it's
horrible!"</p>

<p>Her husband stifled an exclamation of pain and annoyance.</p>

<p>"Could <i>you</i> do it for me, Honor?" he asked. "It can hardly
be left like this?"</p>

<p>She came to him at once, and righted the bandage with deft,
unshrinking fingers, rolling part of the long scarf into a
pad under his arm to ease the aching shoulder.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said. "That's first-rate."</p>

<p>And as he shouted for a much-needed "peg," Honor passed
quietly out of the room.</p>

<p>Evelyn remained standing a little apart, watching her
husband with speculative eyes. Then she came and stood near
him, on the side farthest from the alarming bone that moved
at a touch.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Theo. Are you very cross with me?"</p>

<p>Her lips quivered a little, and the pallor of her face
caught at his heart.</p>

<p>"No, no. We won't make mountains out of molehills, eh,
Ladybird? Kiss and be friends! like a good child, and get to
bed as fast as possible. Mackay will be here soon, and
you'll be best out of the way."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>
<p>He drew her down and kissed her forehead. Then, as she
slipped silently away through his study, and on into the
bedroom beyond, he lay back with a sigh in which relief and
weariness were oddly mingled. He was devoutly thankful when
the arrival of James Mackay dispelled his disturbing train
of thought.</p>

<h4>STICK TO THE FRONTIER.</h4>

<div class="blockpoem">
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"We know our motives least in their confused beginning."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 22.5em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Browning.</span></span><br />
<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Honor</span> sat alone in the drawing-room, a basket of socks and
stockings at her elbow, her thoughts working as busily as
her needle. This girl had reduced the prosaic necessity of
darning to a fine art; and since Evelyn's efforts in that
direction bore an odd resemblance to ill-constructed lattice
windows, Honor had taken pity on the maltreated garments
very early in the day.</p>

<p>Evelyn herself was at the tennis-courts, with the Kresneys
and Harry Denvil, a state of things that had become
increasingly frequent of late; and a ceaseless murmur of two
deep voices came to Honor's ears through the open door of
the study, where Desmond was talking and reading Persian
with his friend Rajinder Singh.</p>

<p>Honor enjoyed working to the accompaniment of that sound. It
had grown pleasantly familiar during the past week, in which
Desmond had been cut off from outdoor activities. When the
Persian lesson was over, he would come in to her for a talk.
Then there would be music, and possibly a game of chess; for
Desmond was an enthusiastic player. They had spent one or
two afternoons in this fashion already, since the night of
the fire; and their intimacy bid fair to ripen into a very
satisfying friendship.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>
<p>To the end of time, writers and thinkers will continue to
insist upon the impossibility of such friendships; and to
the end of time, men and women will persist in playing with
this form of fire. For it is precisely the possibility of
fire under the surface which lends its peculiar fascination
to an experiment old as the Pyramids, yet eternally fresh as
the first leaf-bud of spring.</p>

<p>In the past five years Honor had established two genuine
friendships with men of widely different temperaments; and
she saw herself now&mdash;not without a certain quickening of
heart and pulse&mdash;in a fair way to establishing a third.</p>

<p>The hum of voices ceased; there were footsteps in the hall;
a few hearty words of leave-taking from the Englishman, and
two minutes later he stood before her, his left sleeve
hanging limp and empty; the arm and shoulder strapped
tightly into place beneath the flap of his coat.</p>

<p>"Not gone out yet?" he said, a ring of satisfaction in his
tone. "Going to join Ladybird at the club later on?"</p>

<p>"No. As she had this engagement I stayed at home in case you
might be glad to have some one to 'play with' after your
long lesson was over."</p>

<p>"Just like you!" he declared, with a touch of brotherly
frankness, which was peculiarly pleasing to this
brother-loving girl. "I've been rather overdoing the Persian
this week. You must give me some Beethoven presently. And if
you really mean to 'play with' me you must also leave off
looking so aggressively industrious."</p>

<p>His eyes rested, in speaking, on the rapid movement of her
needle, and he became suddenly aware of the nature of her
work.</p>

<p>"Look here, Honor," he exclaimed. "I draw the line at that!
Ladybird ought not to allow it. We've no right to turn you
into a domestic drudge."</p>

<p>"Ladybird&mdash;as you so delightfully call her&mdash;knows me far too
well to try and stop me when she sees I mean to have my own
way! Shall you mind if I go shares in your special name for
her? It suits her even better than her own."</p>

<p>"Yes, it seems to express her, somehow&mdash;doesn't it?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
<p>An unconscious tenderness invaded his tone, and his glance
turned upon a panel photograph of his wife in her
wedding-dress that stood near him on the mantelpiece.
Watching it thus, he fell into a thoughtful silence, which
Honor made no attempt to break. Speaking or silent his
companionship was equally acceptable to her: and while she
awaited his pleasure a great hole, made by the removal of
one of Evelyn's "lattice windows," filled up apace.</p>

<p>Of a sudden he turned from the picture, and, drawing up a
low chair, sat down before her, leaning a little forward,
his elbow resting on his knee. The urgency and gravity of
his bearing made her at once lay down her work.</p>

<p>"Honor," he began, "I'm bothered ... about Ladybird, ...
that's the truth. I wonder if I can speak without fear of
your misunderstanding me?"</p>

<p>"Try me! I am only too glad to help her in any way."</p>

<p>His intense look softened to a smile.</p>

<p>"You've made that clear enough already. I begin to wonder
what she will do when John comes back to claim you again.
You so thoroughly understand her, and thoroughly&mdash;love her."</p>

<p>"She is a creature born to be loved."</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> to be kept happy," he added very quietly. "But the
vital question is whether that is at all possible in Kohat,
or in any other of our stations; for Kohat is by no means
the worst. She hates the place, doesn't she? She's counting
the days to get away to the Hills. You know you can't look
me straight in the face and say she is happy here."</p>

<p>The unexpected attack struck Honor into momentary silence.
Desmond was fatally quick to perceive the shadow of
hesitation, transient as a breath upon glass; and when she
would have spoken he silenced her with a peremptory hand.</p>

<p>"Don't perjure yourself, Honor. Your eyes have told me all I
wanted to know."</p>

<p>Distress gave her a courage that surprised herself.</p>

<p>"Indeed they have done nothing of the kind! You ask a direct
question, and you are bound in fairness to hear my answer.
The life here is still very new to Evelyn, and she has not
quite found her footing yet;&mdash;that is all. I have had it
from her own lips that the place matters very little to her
so long as she is&mdash;with you; and you go too far in saying
that she is not happy here."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>
<p>But her words did not carry conviction. He was still under
the influence of his wife's curious aloofness since the
night of the fire.</p>

<p>"You're trying to let me down gently, Honor," he said, with
a rather cheerless smile. "And you may as well save yourself
the trouble. Only&mdash;this is where you must <i>not</i>
misunderstand me, please,&mdash;no shadow of blame attaches to
Ladybird if she isn't happy. I had no right to bring her up
to this part of the world, knowing it as I did; and I've no
right to keep her here. That's the position, in a nutshell."</p>

<p>"Do you mean you ought to&mdash;send her away?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;<i>take</i> her away."</p>

<p>Honor started visibly.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;surely&mdash;that's impossible?"</p>

<p>"I think not," he said, in a matter-of-fact tone that
distressed her more keenly than any display of emotion.
"It's merely a question of facing facts. If I had money
enough, I could throw up the Army and take her home. But, as
matters stand, I can only do the next best thing, and give
up&mdash;the Frontier, by exchanging into a down-country
regiment."</p>

<p>"<i>The Frontier...!</i> Theo! Do you realise what you are
saying?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly."</p>

<p>"Oh, but it's folly&mdash;worse than folly! To give up what you
have worked for all these years&mdash;the men who worship
you&mdash;your friends, the regiment&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They would survive the loss. I don't flatter myself I'm
indispensable. Besides, this isn't a question of me or my
friends. I am thinking of Ladybird."</p>

<p>The coolness of his tone, and the set determination of his
mouth, chilled her fervour like a draught of cold air.</p>

<p>"Oh, if only Major Wyndham were here!" she murmured
desperately.</p>

<p>"Thank God he is not! And if he were, it would make no
difference. I shouldn't dream of discussing such a matter
with him or&mdash;any of them. When my mind is made up, I shall
tell him; that is all."</p>

<p>He rose as though the matter were ended; but Honor had no
mind to let him shut the door upon it&mdash;yet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>
<p>"It is strange that you can speak so," she said, "when you
must know, better than any one, what your leaving the
regiment would mean&mdash;to Major Wyndham."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I know," he answered quietly, and the pain in his eyes
made her half regret her own daring. "The only two big
difficulties in the way are my father&mdash;and Paul."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> see a whole army of others almost as big."</p>

<p>"That is only because you are always in sympathy with the
man's point of view."</p>

<p>"A matter like this <i>ought</i> to be looked at first and
foremost from the man's point of view. The truth is, Theo,
that you have simply appealed to me in the hope of having
your own Quixotic notion confirmed. You want me to say,
'Yes, go; you will be doing quite right.' And&mdash;think what
you will of me&mdash;I flatly refuse to say it!"</p>

<p>He regarded her for a few seconds in an admiring silence,
the smile deepening in his eyes. Then:</p>

<p>"Don't you think you are a little hard on me?" he said at
length. "It is not altogether easy to do&mdash;this sort of
thing."</p>

<p>Honor made no immediate reply, though the strongest chords
of her being vibrated in response to his words. Then she
rose also, and stood before him; her head tilted a little
upwards; her candid eyes resting deliberately upon his own.
Standing thus, at her full height, she appeared commandingly
beautiful, but in the stress of the moment the fact counted
for nothing with either of them. All the hidden forces of
her nature were set to remove the dogged line from his
mouth; and he himself, looking on the fair outward show of
her, saw only a mind clear as crystal, lit up by the white
light of truth.</p>

<p>For an instant they fronted one another&mdash;spirits of equal
strength. Then Honor spoke.</p>

<p>"If I <i>do</i> seem hard on you, it is only because I want,
above all things, to convince you that your idea is wrong
from every point of view. You have paid me a very high
compliment to-day. I want you to pay me a still higher one:
to believe that I am speaking the simple truth, as I see it,
from a woman's standpoint, not merely trying to save you
from unhappiness. May I speak out straight?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>
<p>"As plainly as you please, Honor. Your opinion will not be
despised, I promise you."</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;is it fair on Evelyn to make her upbringing
responsible for such a serious turn of the wheel? Would you
give her no voice in the matter&mdash;treat her as if she were a
mere child?"</p>

<p>"She is very little more than a child."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Theo, she is a great deal more. She is a woman, ...
and a wife. The woman's soul isn't fully awake in her yet;
but it may come awake any day. And then&mdash;how would she feel
if she ever found out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She never would&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How can you tell? Women find out most things about the men
they&mdash;care for. It's a risk not worth running. Would she
even acquiesce if you put the matter before her now, child
as she is?"</p>

<p>"Frankly, I don't know. Possibly not. She isn't able to see
ahead much, or look all round a subject."</p>

<p>"Shall you be very angry if I say that you haven't yet
looked thoroughly round this one? The idea probably came to
you as an impulse&mdash;a very fine impulse, I admit; and,
instead of fairly weighing pros and cons, you have simply
been hunting up excuses that will justify you in carrying it
out; because, for the moment, Evelyn seems a little
discontented with things in general."</p>

<p>The hard lines about his mouth relaxed.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> speaking straight with a vengeance, Honor!"</p>

<p>"I know I am. It's necessary sometimes, when people
are&mdash;obstinate!" And she smiled frankly into his troubled
face. "Oh, believe me, it's fatal for the man to throw all
his life out of gear on account of the woman. It's putting
things the wrong way about altogether. In accepting her
husband, a woman must be prepared to accept his life and
work also."</p>

<p>"But, suppose she can't realise either till&mdash;too late?"</p>

<p>"That's a drawback. But if she really cares, it can still be
done. I am jealous for Evelyn. I want her to have the chance
of showing that she has good stuff in her. Give her the
chance, Theo; and if she doesn't quite rise to it, don't
feel that you are in any way to blame."</p>

<p>"I'd be bound to feel that."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>"Then I can only say it would be very wrong-headed of you."
Her eyes softened to a passing tenderness nevertheless. "Let
the blame, if there is any, rest on my shoulders; and we'll
hope that the need may never arise. Now, have I said enough?
Will you&mdash;<i>will</i> you leave things as they are, and put aside
your impossible notion for good?"</p>

<p>The urgency of her request so touched him that he answered
with a readiness which surprised himself.</p>

<p>"No question but you're a friend worth having! I promise you
this much, Honor. I will think very thoroughly over it all,
since you accuse me of not having done so yet! And we'll let
the matter rest for the present, anyway. I'd like to get you
both to the Hills as soon as possible. These Kresneys are
becoming something of a nuisance. It's past my comprehension
how she can find any pleasure in their company. But she has
little enough amusement here, and I'm loth to spoil any of
it. She'll enjoy going up to Murree, though, sooner than she
expected; and as Mackay insists on my taking fifteen days
before getting back to work, I can go with you, and settle
you up there in about a week's time. You'll see after her,
for me, won't you, Honor? She's a little heedless and
inexperienced still; and you'll keep an eye on household
matters more or less?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will, and make her see to them herself, too;
though it seems rather like expecting a flower to learn the
multiplication table! She is so obviously just made to be
loved and protected."</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> kept happy," he insisted, with an abrupt reversion to
his original argument.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;within reasonable limits. Now, sit down, please, and
light up. You've been all this time without a cigar!"</p>

<p>But the cigar was hardly lighted before they were startled
by a confused sound of shouting from the compound;&mdash;a blur
of shrill and deep voices, punctuated by the strained
discordant bark of a dog;&mdash;a bark unmistakable to ears that
have heard it once. Desmond sprang out of his chair.</p>

<p>"By Jove! A mad pariah!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<p>Lifting Rob by the scruff of his neck, he flung that amazed
and dignified person with scant ceremony into the study, and
shut the door; then, judging by the direction of the sound,
hurried out to the front verandah, snatching up a heavy
stick as he passed through the hall. Honor, following not
far behind, went quickly into her own room.</p>

<p>Desmond found his sun-diffused compound abandoned to a
tumult of terror. Fourteen servants and their belongings had
all turned out in force, with sticks, and staves, and
valiant shakings of partially unwound turbans, against the
unwelcome intruder&mdash;a mangy-coated pariah, with lolling
tongue and foam-flecked lips, whose bones showed through
hairless patches of skin; and whose bared fangs snapped
incessantly at everything and nothing, in a manner gruesome
to behold. A second crowd of outsiders, huddled close to the
gates, was also very zealous in the matter of shouting, and
of winnowing the empty air.</p>

<p>As Desmond set foot on the verandah, a four-year-old boy,
bent on closer investigation of the enemy, escaped from the
"home" battalion. His small mother pursued him, shrieking;
but at the first snap the dog's teeth met in the child's
fluttering shirt, and his shrieks soared, high and thin,
above the deeper torrent of sound.</p>

<p>In an instant Desmond was beside him, the stick swung high
over his head. But a low sun smote him straight in the eyes,
and there was scant time for accurate aim. The stick merely
grazed the dog's shoulder in passing; and Desmond almost
lost his balance from the unresisted force of the blow.</p>

<p>The girl-mother caught wildly at her son; and prostrating
herself at a safe distance, babbled incoherent and unheeded
gratitude. The dog, mad with rage and pain, made a
purposeful spring at his one definite assailant; and once
again Desmond, half-blinded with sunlight, swung the heavy
stick aloft. But before it fell a revolver shot rang out
close behind him; and the dog dropped like a stone, with a
bullet through his brain.</p>

<p>A shout of quite another new quality went up from the crowd;
and Desmond, turning sharply on his heel, confronted Honor
Meredith, white to the lips, the strong light making an
aureole of her hair.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>
<p>The hand that held the revolver quivered a little, and he
caught it in so strong a grip that she winced under the
pressure.</p>

<p>"It would be mere impertinence to say 'thank you,'" he
murmured with low-toned vehemence. But his eyes, that sought
her own, shamed the futility of speech. "The sun was
blinding me; and if I'd missed the second time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hush, hush!" she pleaded with a quick catch of her
breath. "Look, there's Rajinder Singh coming back."</p>

<p>"He must have seen what happened; and by the look of him, I
imagine <i>he</i> will have no great difficulty in expressing his
feelings."</p>

<p>Indeed, the tall Sikh, whose finely-cut face and cavernous
eye-bones suggested a carving in old ivory, bowed himself
almost to the ground before the girl who had saved his
admired Captain Sahib from the possibility of a hideous
death.</p>

<p>But in the midst of an impassioned flow of words, his deep
voice faltered; and squaring his shoulders, he saluted
Desmond with a gleam of fire in his eyes.</p>

<p>"There be more things in the heart of a man, Hazúr, than the
tongue can be brought to utter. But, of a truth, the Miss
Sahib hath done good service for the Border this day."</p>

<p>Desmond flung a smiling glance at Honor.</p>

<p>"<i>There's</i> fame for you!" he said, with a lightness that was
mere foam and spray from great deeps. "The whole Border-side
is at your feet!&mdash;But what brought you back again, Rajinder
Singh?"</p>

<p>"Merely a few words I omitted to say to your Honour at
parting."</p>

<p>The words were soon spoken; and the crowd, breaking up into
desultory groups, was beginning to disperse, when, to his
surprise, Desmond saw his wife's jhampan appear between the
gate-posts, and pause for a moment while she took leave of
some one on the farther side. Instinctively he moved forward
to greet her; but, on perceiving her companion, changed his
mind, and stood awaiting her by the verandah steps.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>
<p>The dead dog lay full in the middle of the path; and Honor,
still holding her revolver, stood only a few yards away. At
sight of these things the faint shadow of irritation upon
Evelyn's face deepened to disgust, not unmixed with fear,
and her voice had a touch of sharpness in it as she turned
upon her husband.</p>

<p>"Who on earth put that horrible dog there, Theo? And why is
Honor wandering about with a pistol? I met a whole lot of
natives coming away. Has anything been happening?"</p>

<p>"The dog was mad, and Honor shot him," Desmond answered,
with cool abruptness. Her manner of parting from Kresney had
set the blood throbbing in his temples. "I only had a stick
to tackle him with; and she very pluckily came to my
rescue."</p>

<p>While he spoke, Honor turned and went into the house. She
was convinced that Evelyn would strike a jarring note, and
in her present mood felt ill able to endure it.</p>

<p>Evelyn frowned.</p>

<p>"Oh, Theo, how troublesome you are! If the dog had bitten a
few natives, who'd have cared?"</p>

<p>"Their relations, I suppose. And there was a child in
danger, Evelyn."</p>

<p>"Poor little thing! But you really can't go about trying to
get killed for the benefit of any stray sort of people. I am
thankful I wasn't here!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;it was just as well," her husband answered drily, as
he handed her out of the jhampan. "What brought you back so
early?"</p>

<p>"The sun was too hot. I had a headache; and we were all
playing abominably. I'm going in now, to lie down."</p>

<p>She paused beside him, and her eyes lingered upon his empty
coat-sleeve. Lifting it distastefully between finger and
thumb, she glanced up at him with a droop of her delicate
lips.</p>

<p>"When is it going to be better? I hate to see you looking
all one-sided like that."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he answered humbly. "But Nature won't be
persuaded to hurry herself&mdash;even to please you." He
scrutinised her face with a shade of anxiety.</p>

<p>"You do look white, Ladybird. How would it be if I took you
to Murree in a week's time?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>
<p>"It would be simply lovely! <i>Can</i> you do it&mdash;really? Would
you <i>let</i> me go so soon?"</p>

<p>"<i>Let</i> you go? Do you think I want to keep you here a moment
later than you care to stay?"</p>

<p>"Theo!" Instant reproach clouded the April brightness of her
face. "How horrid you are! I thought you liked to have me
here as long as possible."</p>

<p>He laughed outright at that. He was apt to find her
unreasonableness more charming than irritating.</p>

<p>"Surely, little woman, that goes without saying. But if the
heat is troubling you, and headaches, I like better to have
you where you can be rid of both; and as the notion seems to
please you, we'll consider the matter settled."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Between nine and ten that evening, when the three were
sitting together in the drawing-room, the outer stillness
was broken by a sound of many footsteps and voices rapidly
nearing the house. No native crowd this time. The steps and
voices were unmistakably English; and Desmond rose hastily.</p>

<p>"This must be Rajinder Singh's doing! It looks as if they
meant to overwhelm us in force."</p>

<p>Evelyn had risen also, with a slight frown between her
brows.</p>

<p>"Can't I go to bed before they come, Theo? I'm very tired,
and they're sure to make a dreadful noise."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that won't do at all," he said decisively, a
rare note of reproof in his tone. "They probably won't stop
long, and you must please stay up till they go."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Harry Denvil in white Mess uniform, scarlet
kummerband, and jingling spurs, plunged into the room.</p>

<p>"I'm only the advance guard! The whole regiment's coming on
behind&mdash;even the Colonel&mdash;to drink Miss Meredith's health!"
He turned upon the girl and shook hands with her at great
length. "All the same, you know," he protested laughing,
"it's not fair play for <i>you</i> to go doing that sort of
thing. Wish I'd had the chance of it myself!"</p>

<p>Such speeches are impossible to answer; and Honor was
thankful that the main body of troops arrived in time to
save her from the futile attempt.</p>

<p>But she was only at the beginning of her ordeal.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>
<p>By the time that Mrs Olliver and six men had wrung her hand
with varying degrees of vigour, each adding a characteristic
tribute of thanks and praise, her cheeks were on fire; and a
mist, which she tried vainly to dispel, blurred her vision.</p>

<p>Through that mist, she was aware of Frank vigorously shaking
hands with Desmond, scolding and blessing him in one breath.
"Ah, Theo, man, you're a shocking bad lot!" was her sisterly
greeting. "Never clear out o' one frying-pan till you're
into the next! Thank the Powers Miss Meredith was handy."
And swinging round on her heel she accosted the girl
herself. "No mistaking the stock <i>you</i> come of, Honor, me
dear!"</p>

<p>Submerged in blushes, Honor could scarce command her voice.
"But really&mdash;I only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You only hit the bull's eye like a man, Miss Meredith,"
Captain Olliver took her up promptly. "The Major never told
us he was adding a crack shot to the regiment!" And he swept
her a bow that reduced her to silence.</p>

<p>More overwhelming than all were the few direct words from
Colonel Buchanan himself; a tall, hard-featured Scot, so
entirely absorbed in his profession that he never, save of
dire necessity, set foot in a lady's drawing-room.</p>

<p>Paul Wyndham introduced him, and moved aside, leaving them
together. For an instant he treated the girl to the quiet
scrutiny of clear blue eyes, unpleasantly penetrating. He
had scarcely looked at her till now. Still unreconciled to
Desmond's marriage, he had resented the introduction of a
third woman into the regiment; and he found himself
momentarily bewildered by her beauty.</p>

<p>"I ought to be better acquainted with you, Miss Meredith,"
he said a little stiffly, sincerity struggling through
natural reticence, like a light through a fog. "I'm no
lady's man, as you probably know, but I had to come and
thank you to-night. Desmond's quite my finest officer&mdash;no
disrespect to your brother; he knows it as well as I do&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here you are, Colonel!" Geoff Olliver thrust a long tumbler
into his senior's hand. "We're going to let off steam by
drinking Miss Meredith's health before we go back."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>
<p>Honor looked round hastily, in hopes of effecting an
escape, and was confronted by Desmond's eyes looking
straight into her own. He lifted his glass with a smile of
the frankest friendliness; and the rest followed his
example.</p>

<p>"Miss Meredith, your very good health."</p>

<p>The words went round the room in a deep disjointed murmur;
and Frank Olliver, stepping impulsively forward, held out
her glass to the girl.</p>

<p>"Here's to your health and good luck, with all my heart,
Honor, ... the Honor o' the regiment!" she added, with a
flash of her white teeth.</p>

<p>Uproarious shouts greeted the spontaneous sally.</p>

<p>"Hear, hear! Well played, indeed, Mrs Olliver! Pity Meredith
couldn't have heard that."</p>

<p>Olliver laid a heavy hand on Desmond's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Tell you what, old chap," he said. "You must come back with
us; and, by Jove, we'll make a night of it. Finest possible
thing for you after a week's moping on the sick list; and
we'll just keep Mackay hanging round in case you get knocked
out of shape. I'll slip into uniform myself and follow on.
That suit you, Colonel?"</p>

<p>"Down to the ground; if Mackay has no objection."</p>

<p>But Mackay knew his men too well to have anything of the
sort; and Desmond's eyes gleamed.</p>

<p>"How about uniform for me, sir?" he asked. "I could manage
it after a fashion."</p>

<p>Colonel Buchanan smiled.</p>

<p>"No doubt you could! But I'll overlook it to-night. The
fellows want you. Won't do to keep them waiting!"</p>

<p>Followed a babel of talk and laughter, in the midst of which
Honor, who had moved a little apart, became aware that
Desmond was at her side.</p>

<p>"Never mind them, Honor," he said in a low voice. "They mean
it very well, and they don't realise that it's a little
overwhelming for us both. I won't pile it on by saying any
more on my own account. <i>Wait</i> till I get a chance to repay
you in kind&mdash;that's all!"</p>

<p>His words spurred her to a sudden resolve.</p>

<p>"You have the chance now, if it doesn't seem like taking a
mean advantage of&mdash;things."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<p>"Mean advantages are not in your line. You've only to say
the word."</p>

<p>"Then <i>stick to the Frontier</i>!" she answered, an imperative
ring in her low voice. "Doesn't to-night convince you that
you've no right to leave them all?"</p>

<p>His face grew suddenly grave.</p>

<p>"The only right is to stand by Ladybird&mdash;at all costs."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;I know. But remember what I said about her side
of it. Give her the chance to find herself, Theo; and give
<i>me</i> your word now to think no more about leaving the
Border. Will you?"</p>

<p>He did not answer at once, nor did he remove his eyes from
her face.</p>

<p>"Do you care so much what I do with the rest of my life?" he
said at last very quietly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I do; for Ladybird's sake."</p>

<p>"I see. Well, there's no denying your privilege&mdash;now to have
some voice in the matter. I give you my word, and if it
turns out a mistake, the blame be on my own head. The
fellows are making a move now. I must go. Good-night."</p>

<p>The men departed accordingly with much clatter of footsteps
and jingling of spurs; and only Mrs Olliver remained behind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<p>Evelyn Desmond had succeeded in slipping away unnoticed a
few minutes earlier. She alone, among them all, had spoken
no word of gratitude to her friend.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h4>WE'LL JUST FORGET.</h4>

<div class="blockpoem">
<span style="margin-left: -3em;">"Les petites choses ont leur importance; c'est par elles
toujours qu'on se perde."&mdash;</span><span class="smcap">Dostoievsky.</span><br />
<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">"So</span> the picnic was a success?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite. Mrs Rivers was so clever. She paired us off
beautifully. My pair was Captain Winthrop of the Ghurkas; an
awfully nice man. He talked to me the whole time. He knows
Theo. Says he's the finest fellow in Asia! Rather nice to be
married to the 'finest fellow in Asia,' isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Decidedly. But I don't think we needed <i>him</i> to tell us
that sort of thing." A touch of the girl's incurable pride
flashed in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, I was pleased all the same. He said he was never so
surprised in his life as when he heard Theo had married; but
now he had seen me, he didn't feel surprised any more."</p>

<p>"That was impertinence."</p>

<p>"Not a bit! I thought it was rather nice."</p>

<p>A trifling difference of opinion; but, in point of
character, it served to set the two women miles apart.</p>

<p>Evelyn's remark scarcely needed a reply; and Honor fell into
a thoughtful silence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>
<p>She had allowed herself the rare indulgence of a day "off
duty." Instead of accompanying Evelyn to the picnic, she had
enjoyed a scrambling excursion with Mrs Conolly&mdash;whose
friendship was fast becoming a real possession&mdash;and her two
big babies; exploring hillsides and ravines; hunting up the
rarer wild flowers and ferns; and lunching off sandwiches on
a granite boulder overhanging infinity. This was her idea of
enjoying life in the Himalayas; but the June sun proved a
little exhausting; and she was aware of an unusual weariness
as she lay back in her canvas chair in the verandah of "The
Deodars,"&mdash;a woodland cottage, owing its pretentious name to
the magnificent cedars that stood sentinel on either side of
it.</p>

<p>Her eyes turned for comfort and refreshment to the stainless
wonder of the snows, that were already beginning to don
their evening jewels&mdash;coral and amethyst, opal and pearl.
The railed verandah, and its sweeping sprays of honeysuckle,
were delicately etched upon a sky of warm amber, shading
through gradations of nameless colour into blue, where
cloud-films lay like fairy islands in an enchanted sea.
Faint whiffs of rose and honeysuckle hovered in the still
air, like spirits of the coming twilight, entangling sense
and soul in a sweetness that entices rather than uplifts.</p>

<p>Evelyn Desmond, perched lightly on the railings, showed
ethereal as a large white butterfly, in the daintiness of
her summer finery against a background of glowing sky. She
swung a lace parasol aimlessly to and fro, and her gaze was
concentrated on the buckle of an irreproachable shoe.</p>

<p>Honor, withdrawing her eyes reluctantly from the brooding
peace of mountain and sky, wondered a little at her
pensiveness; wondered also where her thoughts&mdash;if mere
flittings of the mind are entitled to be so called&mdash;had
carried her.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, she was thinking of unpaid bills; since
human lilies of the field, though they neither toil nor
spin, must pay for irreproachable shoes and unlimited summer
raiment.</p>

<p>The girl's own thoughts, as they were apt to do in leisure
moments, had wandered to Kohat: to the men who were working
with cheerful, matter-of-fact courage in the glare of the
little desert-station; and to the one brave woman, who
remained in their midst to hearten them by her own
indomitable gladness of soul.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>
<p>The beauty of the evening bred a longing&mdash;natural in one so
sympathetic&mdash;that they also could be up on this green
hill-top, under the shade of the deodars, enjoying the
exquisite repose of it all.</p>

<p>"Have you heard from Theo this week, Ladybird?" she asked
suddenly. It was the first time she had used the name, for
habit is strong; and Evelyn looked up quickly, the colour
deepening in her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Don't call me Ladybird!" she commanded, with unusual
decision. "It belongs to Theo."</p>

<p>Honor noted her rising colour with a smile of approval.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, dear," she said gently. "I quite understand.
But&mdash;have you heard lately?"</p>

<p>Evelyn's face cleared as readily as a child's.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I forgot to tell you. I had quite a long letter
this morning. Perhaps you would like to read it."</p>

<p>And drawing an envelope from her pocket she tossed it into
Honor's lap.</p>

<p>The girl glanced down at it quickly; but allowed it to lie
there untouched. She knew that Desmond wrote good letters,
and she would have dearly liked to read this one. But a
certain manly strain in her forbade her to trespass on the
privacy of a letter written to his wife.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said; "I think I won't read it, though. I
don't suppose Theo would care about his letters being passed
on to me. I only want to know if things are going on all
right."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; in the usual sort of way. They've had trouble with
those wretched Waziris. Two sentries murdered last week; and
some horses stolen. Oh! and Mrs Olliver has had a bad touch
of fever; and there's cholera in the city, but they don't
think it'll spread. What a gruesome place it is! And what a
mercy we're not there now. By the way," she added, working
her parasol into a crack between two boards, "I met the
Kresneys as I was coming home."</p>

<p>"The Kresneys! Here?"</p>

<p>Honor sat suddenly upright, all trace of weariness gone from
her face.</p>

<p>"Yes. They're up for six weeks, and they seemed so pleased
to see me that&mdash;I asked them in to dinner to-night."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<p>"Evelyn!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;why not?" A spark of defiance glinted through the
dark curves of her lashes.</p>

<p>"You know Theo would hate it."</p>

<p>"I daresay. But he isn't here; so it can't matter to him.
And he need not know anything about it."</p>

<p>"My dear! That would be worse than all!"</p>

<p>Evelyn frowned.</p>

<p>"Really, Honor, for a clever person, you're rather stupid.
It would be simply idiotic to tell him what is sure to annoy
him, when the thing's done and he can't prevent it."</p>

<p>The girl leaned back with an impatient sigh.</p>

<p>"If you feel so sure it will annoy him, why on earth do you
do it? He is so good to you in every possible way."</p>

<p>A great longing came upon her to disclose all that he had
been ready to relinquish five weeks ago.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> know that without your telling me," Evelyn retorted
sharply. "But I think I might do as I like just while I'm up
here. And I mean to&mdash;whatever you say. The Kresneys came
here, instead of going to Mussoorie, chiefly to see me. I
can't ignore them; and I won't."</p>

<p>"Well, for goodness' sake, don't ask them to the house
again, that's all." Then, because she could scarcely trust
herself to say more on the subject, and because she had no
wish to risk a quarrel, she added quickly: "A parcel came
while we were out. Perhaps you'd like to open it before
dinner."</p>

<p>Evelyn was on her feet at once&mdash;the Kresneys forgotten as
though they were not.</p>

<p>"It must be my new dress for the General's garden-party. How
lovely!"</p>

<p>"Another dress? Your almirah's choked with them already."</p>

<p>"Those are only what I got at Simla last year."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>
<p>"You seem to have gone in rather extensively for dresses
last year," Honor remarked, a trifle critically. Since their
arrival in Murree she had become better acquainted with the
details of Evelyn's wardrobe; and the knowledge had troubled
her not a little. "How about your trousseau?"</p>

<p>"Mother gave me hardly <i>any</i> dresses. She said I wouldn't
need them on the Frontier. But I <i>must</i> have decent clothes,
even in the wilderness."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so. Still you will find continual dresses
from Simla a terrible drain on a limited allowance."</p>

<p>A delicate flush crept into Evelyn's cheeks, and her eyes
had an odd glitter that came to them when she felt herself
hard-pressed, yet did not intend to give in.</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i> know about my allowance?"</p>

<p>"I happen to know the amount of it," Honor answered quietly.
"I also know the cost of clothes such as you have been
getting in Simla, and&mdash;I am puzzled to see how the two can
be made to fit. You do <i>pay</i> for your things, I suppose?"
she added, with a flash of apprehension. She herself had
never been allowed to indulge in bills.</p>

<p>Evelyn's colour ebbed at the direct question; and she took
instant refuge in anger and matrimonial dignity, as being
safer than truth.</p>

<p>"Really, Honor, you're getting rather a nuisance just
lately. Scolding and preaching never does me a scrap of
good&mdash;and you know it. What I do with my allowance isn't
anybody's business but my own, and I won't be treated as if
I were a child. After all"&mdash;with a fine mingling of dignity
and scorn&mdash;"<i>I'm</i> the married woman. You're only a
girl&mdash;staying with me; and I think I might be allowed to
manage my own affairs, without <i>you</i> always criticising and
interfering."</p>

<p>By this time Honor had risen also; a line of sternness
hardening her beautiful mouth. Beneath her sustained
cheerfulness lay a passionate temper; and Evelyn's
unexpected attack stung it fiercely into life. Several
seconds passed before she could trust herself to speak.</p>

<p>"Very well, Evelyn," she said, at length, "from to-day there
shall be an end of my criticism and interference. You seem
to forget that you asked for my help. But as you don't need
it any longer I will hand over the account books to you
to-morrow morning; and you had better give Nazar Khan some
orders about dinner. There isn't very much in the house."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
<p>Only once before had Evelyn seen her friend roused to real
indignation; and she was fairly frightened at the effect of
her own hasty words.</p>

<p>"Oh, Honor, don't be so angry as that!" she pleaded
brokenly. "You know I simply can't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But with a decisive gesture Honor set her aside, and walking
straight past her, mounted the steep staircase to her own
room.</p>

<p>Arrived there, she stood still as one dazed, her hands
pressed against her temples. There were times when this girl
felt a little afraid of her own vehemence; which, but for
the heritage of a strong will, and her unfailing reliance on
a Higher Judgment, might indeed have proved disastrous for
herself and others.</p>

<p>With controlled deliberation of movement, she drew a chair
to the hired dressing-table, which served as davenport, and
began to write.</p>

<p>She set down date and address and the words, "My dear
Theo,"&mdash;no more. What was it she meant to say to him? That
from to-day Evelyn must be left to manage her affairs alone;
that she could no longer be responsible for her friend's
doings, social or domestic; but that she was willing to
remain with her for the season, if he wished it? How were
such things to be worded? Was it even possible to say them
at all?</p>

<p>Her eye fell upon the envelope containing his last letter.
Mechanically she drew it out and read it through again very
slowly. It was a long letter, full of their mutual
interests; of the music and the Persian,&mdash;which she was now
studying under his tuition;&mdash;of Wyndham, Denvil, Mrs
Olliver, and his men; very little about himself. But it was
written as simply and directly as he spoke,&mdash;the only form
of letter that annihilates space; and it was signed, "Always
your friend, Theo Desmond."</p>

<p>Before she reached the signature the fire had faded from her
eyes. She returned it to the envelope, took up the sheet on
which three lines were written, and tearing it across and
across, dropped it into the cane basket at her side.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>
<p>"I can't do it," she murmured. "What right have I to let
him call himself my friend, if I fail him the first time
things take an unpleasant turn?"</p>

<p>She decided, nevertheless, that Evelyn might well be allowed
to realise her own helplessness a little before the reins
were again taken out of her hands. Then she went downstairs
and out into the golden evening, to cool her cheeks and
quiet her pulses by half an hour of communing with the
imperturbable peace of the hills.</p>

<p>Evelyn, standing alone in the drawing-room, bewildered and
helpless as a starfish stranded by the tide, heard Honor's
footsteps pass the door and die away in the distance. An
unreasoning fear seized her that she might be going over to
Mrs Conolly to stay there for good; and at the thought a sob
rose in her throat. Flinging aside her parasol, which fell
rattling to the floor, she sank into the nearest chair and
buried her face in the cushion.</p>

<p>She knew right well that her words had been ungrateful and
unjust; yet in her heart she was more vexed with Honor for
having pushed her into a corner than with herself for her
defensive flash of resentment. More than all was she
overwhelmed by a sense of utter helplessness, of not knowing
where to turn or what to do next.</p>

<p>"Oh, if only Theo were here!" she lamented. "He would never
be unkind to me, I know." Yet the ground of her woe reminded
her sharply that if her husband had knowledge of the bills
lying at that moment in her davenport, he might possibly be
so unkind to her&mdash;as she phrased it&mdash;that she did not dare
tell him the truth. He had spoken to her once on the subject
of debt in no uncertain terms; and she had resolved
thenceforth to deal with her inevitable muddles in her own
way,&mdash;the simple fatal way of letting things slide, and
hoping that they would somehow come right in the end. But
there seemed no present prospect of such a consummation; and
for a while she gave herself up to a luxury of self-pity.
Tides in her mind ebbed and flowed aimlessly as seaweed.
Everything was hopeless and miserable. It was useless trying
to be good; and she supposed Honor would never help her
again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>
<p>Then her thoughts stumbled on the Kresneys. It must be
nearly half-past six, and dinner was at a quarter past
eight. But, as things now stood, their coming was
impossible. She must send them a note to say Honor was not
well; for who could tell how this new, angry Honor might
choose to behave if they arrived in spite of all?</p>

<p>The need for action roused her, and she went over to her
davenport. But on lifting the lid her eyes fell upon the
little sheaf of bills&mdash;and again the Kresneys faded into
insignificance. She took up the detested slips of paper;
laid them out one by one on the table; and, sitting down
before them, contemplated them with knitted brows and a
hopeless droop of her lips.</p>

<p>No need to look into them in detail. She knew their
contents, and the sum of them by heart. She knew that they
amounted in all to more than six hundred rupees; and that
another four hundred, possibly more, was still owing in
different directions.</p>

<p>Where in all the world was such a sum to be found without
Theo's help? An appeal to Honor would be worse than useless.
Honor was so stupid about such things. Her one idea would be
immediate confession. A hazy notion haunted Evelyn that
people who were in straits borrowed money from somewhere, or
some one. But her knowledge of this mysterious transaction
went no further; and even she was able to perceive that from
so nebulous a starting-point no definite advance could be
made. She had also heard of women selling their jewels, and
wondered vaguely who were the convenient people who bought
them; though this alternative did not commend itself to her
in any case.</p>

<p>Yet by some means the money must be found. Her earliest
creditors were beginning to assert themselves; to thank her
in advance for sums which she saw no hope of sending them;
and, worse than all, she lived in daily dread lest any of
them should be inspired to apply to Theo himself. Look where
she would a blank wall confronted her; and in the midst of
the blankness she sat, a dainty, dejected figure, with her
pitiless pile of bills.</p>

<p>"Krizney, Miss Sahib, <i>argya</i>."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The kitmutgar's voice jerked her back to the necessities of
the moment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>
<p>Well, mercifully, Honor was out. It would be a comfort to
see any one, and get away from her own thoughts. Also she
could explain about the dinner; and, hastily gathering up
her papers, she sent out the customary "salaam."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs Desmond, I <i>do</i> hope I am not disturbing you." Miss
Kresney came forward with a rather too effusive warmth of
manner. "But you forgot to mention if you dine at a quarter
to eight or a quarter past; and I was not certain if you
meant us to dress or not."</p>

<p>Miss Kresney would probably have been amazed could she have
seen these two Englishwomen dining together.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," Evelyn answered simply, "we always dress in the
evening, Honor and I. But&mdash;please don't think me very
rude&mdash;I'm afraid I must ask you and your brother to put off
coming till&mdash;some other night. I was just going to send you
a note; because Honor is&mdash;not at all well. She has been out
in the sun all day, and her head is bad. She must keep quiet
to-night. You see, don't you, that I can't help it? It isn't
my fault."</p>

<p>Linda Kresney's face had fallen very blank; but she pulled
herself together, and called up a cold little smile.</p>

<p>"Of course not, Mrs Desmond. How could I think it is <i>your</i>
fault, when you have always been so veree kind to us? We
often say it is a pity every one is not so kind as you are.
I am sorry Miss Meredith is not well." An acid note invaded
her voice. She had her own suspicions of Honor, as being too
obviously Captain Desmond's friend. "My brother will be
terribly disappointed. No doubt we can come some day veree
soon instead."</p>

<p>But Evelyn was too self-absorbed to detect the obvious hint.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I hope so," she agreed, without enthusiasm; then,
seeing puzzled dissatisfaction in Linda Kresney's eyes, made
haste to add: "Perhaps you'll stay a little now, as you are
not coming to-night. It's quite early still, and I'm all
alone."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<p>Miss Kresney sat down with unconcealed alacrity, and Evelyn
followed her example, laying her hand on the tell-tale
papers. The trouble of her mind showed so clearly in her
eyes and lips, that the girl, who had begun to grow really
fond of her, was emboldened to risk a vague proffer of
sympathy. She had never as yet found the opportunity her
brother so desired of making herself useful; and she was
quick-witted enough to perceive that Fate might be favouring
her at last.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you have been worried about something, Mrs
Desmond," she began warily. "Perhaps after all I had better
not stay here, bothering you to make talk. Unless perhaps&mdash;I
can help you in any way. I should be very glad to, if you
will not think me officious to say so. I cannot bear to see
you look so unhappee. It is not bad news from Kohat, I
hope?"</p>

<p>Evelyn's smile was a very misty affair.</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;it's not that," she said, and broke off short.</p>

<p>Miss Kresney waited for more&mdash;her face and figure one
fervent note of interrogation. She had tact enough to
realise that she could not press verbal inquiry further.</p>

<p>But her air of interested expectation was not lost on Evelyn
Desmond. A pressing need was urging her to unburden her mind
through the comforting channels of speech. Cut off, by her
own act, from the two strong natures on whom she leaned for
sympathy and help, there remained only this girl, who would
certainly give her the one, and might possibly give her the
other, in the form of practical information. It was this
last thought that turned the scale in Miss Kresney's favour;
and Evelyn spoke.</p>

<p>"I think it's very nice of you to mind that I am unhappy,
and to want to help me. But I don't know whether you can;
because it's&mdash;it's about money."</p>

<p>The merest shadow of astonishment flittered across Miss
Kresney's face. But she said no word, and Evelyn went
on&mdash;her nervousness giving way rapidly before the relief of
speech.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>
<p>"I have a whole heap of bills here, for dresses and things,
that I simply can't pay for out of my allowance. It's not
because my husband doesn't give me enough," she added, with
a pathetic flash of loyalty. "He gives me all he can
possibly spare. But I'm stupid and unpractical. I just order
clothes when I want them, and never think about the price
till the bill comes in, and then it's too late! My mother
did it all before I married. I wish to goodness she had
taught me to manage for myself; but it's no use thinking of
that now. The question is&mdash;where can I get money to pay
these bills without troubling my husband about them. I must
find some way to do it, only&mdash;I don't the least know how.
Aren't there natives out here who buy people's jewels,
or&mdash;or lend them money when they want it in a hurry? I
thought&mdash;perhaps&mdash;you might know whether I could manage to
do it&mdash;up here?"</p>

<p>The surprise in Miss Kresney's face deepened to alarm.</p>

<p>"Oh, but indeed, Mrs Desmond, you cannot do anything like
that. The native money-lenders are veree bad people to deal
with; and they ask such big interest, that if you once start
with them it is almost impossible to get free again. You say
you are inexperienced about money, and that would make it
far worse. You cannot do anything of that kind&mdash;reallee."</p>

<p>Evelyn rose in an access of helpless impatience.</p>

<p>"But if I can't do that, what <i>can</i> I do?" she cried. "I've
got to do <i>some</i>thing&mdash;somehow, don't you see? Some of them
are beginning to bother me already, and&mdash;it frightens me."</p>

<p>A long silence followed upon her simple, impassioned
statement of the case. Miss Kresney was meditating a
startling possibility.</p>

<p>"There is only one thing that I can suggest," she ventured
at length, "and that is I could lend you some money myself.
I haven't a great deal. But if three hundred rupees would
help you to settle some of the bills, I would feel only too
proud if you would take it. There will be no interest to
pay; and you could let me have it back in small sums just
whenever you could manage it."</p>

<p>With a gasp of incredulity Evelyn sank back into her chair.</p>

<p>"D'you <i>mean</i> that?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Kresney, I don't know why you should be so kind to
me! How can I take such a lot of money&mdash;from you?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why not, if I am glad to give it?"</p>

<p>Indeed the sum seemed to her an inconsiderable trifle beside
the certainty of Owen's praise, of Owen's entire
satisfaction.</p>

<p>For a clear three minutes Evelyn Desmond sat silent,
irresolute; her mind a formless whirl of eagerness and
uncertainty, hope and fear. The novelty of the transaction
rather than any glimmering of the complications it might
engender held her trembling on the brink; and Miss Kresney
awaited her decision with downcast eyes, her fingers
mechanically plaiting and unplaiting the silken fringe of
the table-cloth.</p>

<p>Sounds crept in from without and peopled the waiting
stillness. Evelyn Desmond had no faintest forewarning of the
grave issues that hung upon her answer, yet she was
unaccountably afraid. Her driven heart cried out for the
support of her husband's presence; and her voice, when words
came at last, was pitifully unsteady.</p>

<p>"It is so difficult not to say Yes."</p>

<p>"Why will you not say it, then? And it would all be
comfortably settled."</p>

<p>"Would it? I don't seem able to believe that. Only if I <i>do</i>
say Yes, you must promise not to tell&mdash;your brother."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that would not be possible. How could I arrange
such a thing without letting my brother know about it?"</p>

<p>"Then I can't take the money."</p>

<p>Evelyn's voice was desperate but determined. Some spark of
intuition enabled her to see that any intrusion of Kresney
set the matter beyond the pale of possible things; and
nothing remained for Linda but compromise or retreat.</p>

<p>She unhesitatingly chose the former. A few reassuring words
would cost little to utter; and if circumstances should
demand a convenient forgetfulness, none but herself need
ever be aware of the fact. She leaned across the table, and
her tone was a triumph of open-hearted sympathy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>
<p>"Mrs Desmond, you know quite well that I cannot leave you
unhappy like this. If you are so determined that my brother
must not know, I think I could manage without his help. Come
to the Hotel to-morrow at half-past ten, and we will send
off three hundred rupees to those who are troubling you most
for payment."</p>

<p>Miss Kresney was as good as her word. She drew three hundred
rupees in notes from her own small bank account, and herself
went with Evelyn to the post-office whence they were safely
despatched to Simla.</p>

<p>Some three evenings later, Owen Kresney bade his sister
good-night with a quite phenomenal display of affection.</p>

<p>"You're a regular little trump, Linda!" he declared. "I
never gave you credit for so much good sense. By Jove! I'd
give a month's pay for a sight of Desmond's face if he ever
finds <i>this</i> out! I expect he stints that poor little woman
and splashes all the money on polo ponies. Glad you were
able to help her; and whatever you do, don't let her pay you
back too soon. If you're short of cash, you've only to ask
me."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>For the space of a week Honor held inflexibly aloof; and the
effort it cost her seemed out of all proportion to the
mildness of the punishment inflicted. It is an old
story&mdash;the inevitable price paid by love that is strong
enough to chastise. But this great paradox, the corner-stone
of man's salvation, is a stumbling-block to lesser natures.
In Evelyn's eyes Honor was merely cruel, and her own week of
independence a nightmare of helpless irritation. She made
one effort at remonstrance; and its futility crushed her to
earth.</p>

<p>During the evening of their talk the matter had been tacitly
avoided between them; but when, on the following morning,
Honor laid books and bills upon the davenport where Evelyn
sat writing, she caught desperately at the girl's hand.</p>

<p>"Honor, it isn't fair. How <i>can</i> you be so unkind?"</p>

<p>Honor drew her hand decisively away.</p>

<p>"Please let the subject alone," she said coolly. "If you
persist in talking of it, you will drive me to go and sit in
my own room&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>
<p>A week later, however, when she returned from a ride to
find Evelyn again at the detested davenport, her head bowed
upon her arms, like a flower broken with the wind, all the
inherent motherhood in her rose up and overflowed. Hastily
crossing the room she knelt down beside the small tragic
figure and kissed a pearl-white fragment of forehead; the
only spot available at the moment. "Poor darling!" she
whispered. "Is it really as bad as all that?"</p>

<p>Caresses from Honor were so rare that for an instant Evelyn
was taken aback; then she laid her head on the girl's
shoulder with a sigh of pure content.</p>

<p>"Oh, Honor! the world seems all broken to pieces when <i>you</i>
are unkind to me!"</p>

<p>Honor kissed her again.</p>

<p>"I won't be unkind to you any more; and we'll just forget
from this minute that it ever happened at all."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>
<p>But to forget is not to undo; and during their brief
estrangement Evelyn Desmond had added a link to the chain of
Fate, whose strongest coils are most often wrought by our
own unskilful fingers.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Behold</span>! Captain Sahib,&mdash;there where the sky touches earth.
In the space of half an hour we arrive."</p>

<p>Desmond lifted sun-weary eyes to the horizon, and nodded.</p>

<p>When a man is consumed with thirst, and scorched to the
bone, by five hours of riding through a furnace seven times
heated in the teeth of a blistering wind, he is chary of
speech; and the two rode forward in silence&mdash;mere specks
upon the emptiness of earth and sky&mdash;keeping their horses to
the long-distance canter that kills neither man nor beast. A
detachment of forty sabres followed in their wake; and the
rhythmical clatter rang monotonously in their ears.</p>

<p>The speck on the horizon was an outpost&mdash;a boundary mark of
empire,&mdash;where a little party of men watched, night and day,
for the least sign of danger from the illusive quiet of the
hills.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>
<p>It is these handfuls of men, natives of India all,
stationed in stone watch-towers twenty miles apart along the
Border, who keep the gateway of India barred; and who will
keep it barred against all intruders for all time. The
unobtrusive strength of India's Frontier amazes the
new-comer. But only those who have spent their best years in
its service know the full price paid for the upkeep of that
same strength in hardship, unremitting toil, and the lives
of picked men.</p>

<p>As the riders neared the post its outline showed, stern and
clear-cut, against the blue of the sky. A single circular
room, loop-holed and battlemented, set upon an outward
sloping base of immense solidity, and surrounded by a
massive stone wall:&mdash;a tower in which ten men could hold
their own against five hundred. The look-out sentry,
sighting the detachment afar off, gave the word to his
companions, who lowered the ladder that served them for
staircase; and when Desmond's party drew rein the door in
the wall stood open to receive them.</p>

<p>During the halt that followed, the men, having fed and
watered their horses, took what rest they might in patches
of burning shadow within the wall. Though the sun-saturated
masonry breathed fire, it served to shelter them from the
withering wind that scours the Border at this fiery time of
year.</p>

<p>Desmond, who had breakfasted five hours earlier on stale
bread and a few sardines, lunched, with small appetite, on
biscuits and a slab of chocolate, and moistened his parched
throat with tepid whisky-and-water. Quenching his thirst was
an achievement past hoping for till Kohat itself should be
reached.</p>

<p>He had left the station with his detachment early on the
previous day; had relieved four outposts between dawn and
dusk, covering eighty miles of desert road, with four brief
halts for rest; and had spent a night of suffocating
wakefulness in a sun-baked windowless room, built out from
the base of the last post relieved. It was all in the day's
work&mdash;as Frontier men understand work. The exposure and long
hours in the saddle had little effect upon his whipcord and
iron frame: but a sharp attack of fever&mdash;unrecorded in his
letter to his wife&mdash;had slackened his alertness of body and
spirit; and it was with an unusual sense of relief that he
faced the last twenty-mile stretch of road, leaving behind
him six fresh men to take up the task of watching the blank,
unchanging face of the hills.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<p>Three hours later, the little party turned their horses'
heads towards Kohat. The sun still smote the uncomplaining
earth, and many miles of riding lay before them. But at
least it was the beginning of the end; a fact which the two
stout-hearted chargers seemed to recognise as clearly as
their riders. The Ressaldar, who had not failed to note his
Captain's slight change of bearing, proposed a short cut
across country well known to himself.</p>

<p>"Hazúr," he urged, "there runs a long deep nullah, straight
as a lance, across the plain; and as the sun falls lower, it
would give some measure of shade."</p>

<p>"Well spoken, Ressaldar Sahib! I have had my fill of the
road. I'm for the nullah. Come on, men."</p>

<p>And, striking out across country, they vanished from the
earth's surface, entering one of those giant clefts in the
clay soil formed by the early downrush of torrents from the
hills.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the midst of a swinging canter, the Ressaldar
reined in his horse, and the rest followed suit. The old
Sikh threw up his head, as a stag will do at the first
whisper of danger. In the strong light his chiselled face,
with its grey beard scrupulously parted and drawn up under
his turban, showed lifeless as a statue; and his eyes had
the far-off intentness of one who listens with every fibre
of his being.</p>

<p>Desmond watched him in a growing bewilderment that verged on
impatience.</p>

<p>"What's up now?" he demanded sharply.</p>

<p>But no flicker disturbed the rigid face: the keen eyes gave
no sign. The old man raised a hand as if enjoining silence,
dismounted hastily, and, kneeling down, pressed his ear
close against the ground.</p>

<p>Desmond's suspense was short-lived but keen.</p>

<p>In less than ten seconds the Ressaldar was beside him, one
hand on his bridle, a consuming anxiety in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Hazúr, it is a spate from the hills," he said between quick
breaths. "It is coming with the speed of ten thousand devils
and there are five miles to go before we can leave the
nullah."</p>

<p>"Mount, then," the Englishman replied with cool decision.
"We can but ride."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<p>And swiftly, as tired horses could lay legs to ground, they
rode.</p>

<p>Desmond could catch no sound as yet of the oncoming danger;
but the practised ears of the native detected its increase,
even through the rattle of hoofs that beat upon the brain
like panic terror made audible.</p>

<p>"Faster,&mdash;faster!" he panted. His Captain's danger was the
one coherent thought in his mind. Desmond merely nodded
reassurance; and shifting a little in his saddle, eased
matters as far as possible for <i>Badshah Pasand</i>.
<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The ground raced beneath their horses' hoofs. The serene
strip of sky raced above their heads. The imprisoning walls
fell apart before their eyes, seeming to divide like a cleft
stick as they drew near, and reeling away on either hand as
they passed on. All things in earth and heaven seemed
fleeing in mortal haste save only themselves.</p>

<p>Theo Desmond heard the voice of the enemy at last:&mdash;an
ominous roar, growing inexorably louder every minute. At the
sound his head took a more assured lift; his mouth a firmer
line; and the fire of determination deepened in his eyes.</p>

<p>By a movement of the rein he urged Badshah Pasand to renewed
effort. But the devoted animal was nearing the end of his
tether, and his rider knew it. Thick spume flakes blew
backward from his lips, and the sawing motion of his head
told its own tale.</p>

<p>Sher Dil, who was still going lustily, gained upon him by a
neck, and the Ressaldar turned in his saddle.</p>

<p>"The spurs, Hazúr&mdash;the <i>spurs</i>!" he entreated, knowing well
his Captain's abstemiousness in this regard.</p>

<p>But Desmond shook his head. Badshah Pasand was doing his
utmost; and neither man nor beast can do more. He merely
rose in the stirrups, pressed his heels lightly against the
quivering flanks and, leaning forward, spoke a few words of
encouragement almost in the charger's ear.</p>

<p>The sensitive animal sprang forward with a last desperate
output of strength; and in the same instant a hoarse shout
broke from Rajinder Singh.</p>

<p>"An opening&mdash;an opening, Captain Sahib! By the mercy of God
we are saved!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>
<p>Five minutes later the whole party drew rein on the upper
levels of earth, and their sometime pursuer swept
tumultuously onward fifteen feet below.</p>

<p>Desmond's eyes had an odd light in them as he turned from
the swirling waters to the impassive face of the man who had
saved their lives.</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;not&mdash;forget," he said with quiet emphasis.</p>

<p>The old Sikh shook his head with a rather uncertain smile.</p>

<p>"True talk, Hazúr. I had known it without assurance. Yet was
mine own help no great matter. It was written that my
Captain Sahib should not die thus!"</p>

<p>"That may be," Desmond answered gravely, for he had been
strangely upheld by the same conviction. "Yet there be
also&mdash;these others. In my thinking it is no small <i>matter</i>
that, except for your quickness of mind and hearing,
forty-four good men and horses would now be at the mercy of
that torrent. But this is no time for words. It still
remains to reach Kohat before sundown."</p>

<p>The sun was slipping behind the hills, with the broad smile
of a tyrant who fully enjoys the joke, when Desmond drew up
before his own verandah and slid to the ground.</p>

<p>"Thank God that's over!" he muttered audibly. But he did not
at once enter the house. His first care, as always, was for
the horse he rode; and with him it was no mere case of the
"merciful man," but of sheer love for that unfailing servant
of the human race.</p>

<p>He accompanied Badshah Pasand to the stable, superintended
the removal of his saddle, and looked him carefully all
over. That done, he issued explicit orders for his treatment
and feeding: the great charger&mdash;as though fully aware of his
master's solicitude,&mdash;nuzzling a mouse-coloured nose against
his shoulder the while.</p>

<p>Arrived in the comparative coolness of the hall, he shouted
for a drink, and a bath. Then, turning towards the
drawing-room, promised himself a few minutes blessed
relaxation in the depths of his favourite chair.</p>

<p>But passing between the gold-coloured curtains he saw that
which checked his advance, and banished all thought of
relaxation from his brain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>
<p>Harry Denvil&mdash;whose buoyancy and simplicity of heart had
led Desmond to christen him the Boy&mdash;sat alone at Evelyn's
bureau, his head between his hands, despair in every line of
his figure.</p>

<p>Desmond regarded him thoughtfully, marvelling that the
sounds of his own arrival should have passed unheard. Then
he went forward, and laid his hand on the Boy's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Harry! I don't seem to recognise <i>you</i> in that attitude.
Anything seriously wrong?"</p>

<p>Denvil started, and revealed a face of dogged dejection.</p>

<p>"You here?" he said listlessly. "Never heard you come in."</p>

<p>"That's obvious. But&mdash;about yourself?"</p>

<p>The Boy choked down a sigh.</p>

<p>"Why the deuce should I bore you with myself, when you're
hot and tired? I've been a confounded fool; if not worse,
and the devil's in the luck wherever I turn."</p>

<p>But Desmond waited in expectant silence for the Boy's
trouble to overflow. While he waited, the coveted "drink"
arrived, and he emptied the long tumbler almost at a gulp.
The station had run out of ice&mdash;a cheerful habit of Frontier
stations; but at least the liquid was cool and stinging.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said at length, Denvil having returned to his
former attitude. "I want something more explicit. How am I
to help you, if you slam the door in my face?"</p>

<p>"Don't see how you can help me. I've only been ... a great
many kinds of a fool: and <i>you</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what of me? I've been plenty of kinds of fool in my
time, I assure you. Money's the backbone of your trouble, no
doubt. Nothing worse, I hope?"</p>

<p>Denvil's honest eyes met his own without flinching.</p>

<p>"No, on my honour&mdash;nothing worse. The money's bad enough."
And the trouble came out in a quick rush of
words&mdash;explanatory, contrite, despairing&mdash;all in one breath.
For the Boy had Irish blood in his veins; and the initial
difficulty over, he found it an unspeakable relief to
disburden his soul to the man who had "brothered" him ever
since he joined the Force.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<p>Desmond, perceiving that the overflow, once started, was
likely to be exhaustive and complete, took out pipe and
tobacco, balanced himself on the arm of a chair, and
listened gravely to the Boy's disjointed story.</p>

<p>It was a long story, and a commonplace one, if even the most
trivial record of human effort and failure can be so styled.
It was the story of half the subalterns in our Imperial
Army&mdash;of small pay, engulfed by heavy expenses, avoidable
and unavoidable; the upkeep of much needless uniform; too
big a wine bill at Mess; polo ponies, and other luxurious
necessities of Indian life, bought on credit; the inevitable
appeal to the "<i>shroff</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> involving interest upon
interest; the final desperate attempt to mend matters by
high stakes at cards, and fitful, injudicious backing of
horses, most often with disastrous results.</p>

<p>"Have you the smallest idea what the total damage amounts
to?" asked Desmond, when all was said. "I'm bound to know
everything now."</p>

<p>Denvil nodded.</p>

<p>"Close on fifteen hundred, I think," he answered,
truthfully.</p>

<p>"Why, in Heaven's name, didn't you tell me all this sooner?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I kept hoping to get square somehow&mdash;without that. I
wanted to stay in your good books; and I saw you were rather
down on chaps who are casual about money. But I seem to be
made that way, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So are most of us, my dear chap. But it's up to you to make
yourself some other way, if you don't want to come a cropper
and leave the Service. I hope I am no Pharisee, but I've
been reared to believe that living in debt is an
aristocratic, and rather mean form of theft. My notion of
you doesn't square with that; and I know a good man when I
see one. You'll never mend matters, I assure you, by playing
the fool over horses and cards. How about your mother?"</p>

<p>Denvil looked down at the blank sheet of foreign note-paper
before him, and answered nothing. He was the only son of his
mother, and she was a widow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<p>"Can't you see that the fact of your having no father to
pull you up sharp puts you on your honour to keep straight
in every way, on her account? Does she know anything about
all this?"</p>

<p>"How <i>could</i> I tell her?" the Boy murmured, without looking
up. "She thinks me no end of a fine chap; and&mdash;and&mdash;I'm
hanged if I know how to answer her letters since&mdash;things
have got so bad&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When did you write last?"</p>

<p>"About six weeks ago."</p>

<p>Desmond flung out an oath.</p>

<p>"Confound you!" he cried hotly. "What do you think she's
imagining by now? All manner of hideous impossibilities. I
suppose you never gave <i>that</i> a thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Boy looked up quickly, pain and pleading in his blue
eyes. "I say, Desmond, don't hit so straight. I know I've
been a brute to her; and I feel bad enough about it, without
being slanged&mdash;by <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>Theo Desmond's face softened, and he took the Boy's
shoulders between his hands.</p>

<p>"My dear lad," he said gently. "I'm sorry if I hit too hard.
But I feel rather strongly on that subject. I've no wish to
slang you. I only want to set you on your feet, and <i>keep
you</i> there. So we may as well get to business at once."</p>

<p>"Set me on my feet! How the devil's <i>that</i> to be done?"</p>

<p>Desmond smiled.</p>

<p>"It's simply a question of making up one's mind to things.
In the first place we must sell Roland. He's the best pony
you have."</p>

<p>Harry straightened himself sharply, but Desmond's gesture
commanded silence.</p>

<p>"It's a cruel wrench, I know," he said gently. "Few men
understand that better than myself. But it's all you can do.
And you're bound to do it. You can advertise him as trained
by me. He's safe to fetch seven hundred that way."</p>

<p>Denvil bent his head in desperate resignation.</p>

<p>"You are down on a fellow, Desmond. How about the other
eight?"</p>

<p>"That will be&mdash;my affair."</p>

<p>Again the Boy was startled into protest.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>
<p>"Look here! That's impossible. I couldn't pay you back
within the next three years."</p>

<p>"Did I say anything about paying me back?"</p>

<p>"<i>Desmond</i>&mdash;you don't mean&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and Denvil was answered. He brought his fist
down on the bureau with such force that Evelyn's
knick-knacks danced again.</p>

<p>"By God, I won't have it!" he protested passionately. "I'll
not take such a sum of money from you."</p>

<p>Desmond's smile showed both approval and amusement.</p>

<p>"No call for violence, Boy! I told you my mind was made up;
and it's folly wasting powder and shot against a stone
wall."</p>

<p>"Look here, though&mdash;can you manage it&mdash;easily?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can manage it." And in the rush of relief Harry
failed to note the significant omission of the adverb. "But
it's to be a square bargain between us. No more <i>shroffs</i>;
no more betting, or I come down on you like a ton of coals
for my eight hundred. Stick to whist and polo in playtime.
Polish up your Pushtoo, and get into closer touch with your
Pathans. Start Persian with me, if you like, and replace
Roland with the money you get for passing. But first of all
write to your mother, and tell her the chief part of the
truth. Not my share in it, please. That remains between
ourselves and&mdash;my wife. She'll understand, never fear.
Now&mdash;shake hands on that, and stick to it, will you?"</p>

<p>"Desmond, you <i>are</i> a trump!"</p>

<p>"No need for compliments between you and me, Harry. Shut up
and get on with your letter."</p>

<p>Then, because his mind was freed from anxiety, he realised
that the Boy's hand felt like hot parchment, and that his
eyes were unusually bright.</p>

<p>"You've got fever on you," he said brusquely. "Feel bad?"</p>

<p>"Pretty average. My head's been going like an engine these
two days. Couldn't eat anything yesterday or get a wink of
sleep last night. That's what set my conscience stirring
perhaps."</p>

<p>Desmond laughed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>
<p>"Likely as not! I'm off for Mackay all the same. Get into
my chair and stay there till further orders. Don't bother
your head about that letter. It shan't miss the mail. I'll
write it myself to-night."</p>

<p>An invisible reminder from the doorway that the
Heaven-born's bath had long been waiting, elicited a
peremptory order for the Demon; and Amar Singh departed,
mystified but obedient. The Sahib he worshipped, with the
implicit worship of his race, was a very perplexing person
at times.</p>

<p>James Mackay's verdict&mdash;given well out of the patient's
hearing&mdash;was immediate and to the point.</p>

<p>"Typhoid, of course&mdash;104°. Fool of a boy not to have sent
for me sooner. Ought to have been in bed two days ago. Get
him there sharp, and do what you can with wet sheets and
compresses. I'll wire for a nurse, but we shan't get one.
Never do. Not a ounce of ice in the place, and won't be for
three days. That's always the way. He'll keep you on the go
all night by the looks of him. May as well let the Major do
most of it. You'd be none the worse for a few hours in bed
yourself."</p>

<p>A certain lift of Desmond's head signified tacit denial, and
the astute Scotsman knew better than to insist. Meeting
Wyndham at the gate, he counselled a policy of
non-resistance.</p>

<p>"The fellow's overdone without knowing it," he said. "Take
my advice, man, and let him gang his ain gait. Fever or no,
he's hard as nails, and he'll be glad enough to knock under
in twenty-four hours' time."</p>

<p>Throughout that night of anxious battling with the fire of
fever the two Englishmen seemed translated into mechanical
contrivances for the administering of milk, brandy, and
chicken-broth; for the incessant changing of soaked sheets,
that were none too cool at best; and for allaying, as far as
might be, a thirst that no water on earth can quench.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>
<p>Nothing draws men into closer union than a common danger,
or a common anxiety; and in the past twelve years these two
had stood shoulder to shoulder through both many times over.
But their zeal produced no manifest results. Denvil's
temperature rose steadily, and his stress of mind broke out
in a semi-coherent babble of remorse and self-justification,
of argument and appeal, of desperate reckonings in regard to
ways and means. Desmond left his station by the bed and
crossed over to his friend, who was noiselessly washing a
cup and saucer.</p>

<p>"Don't hear any more of that than you can help. Fact, you
might as well take your chance of a short rest till he's
quieter. I'll come and tell you, no fear."</p>

<p>Paul glanced up with his slow smile from the saucer he was
polishing with elaborate care.</p>

<p>"On your word, Theo?"</p>

<p>"On my word."</p>

<p>And he retired obediently to his own room&mdash;the room that in
the cold weather had belonged to Honor Meredith; that, even
now, empty casket though it was, awoke in him a subtle sense
of her presence; of the strength and cheerfulness that
crowned her beauty like a diadem, and transformed his
outlook on life.</p>

<p>The letter to Mrs Denvil was written in the small hours.
Harry never discovered its contents; but his mother, after
reading it half a dozen times, locked it up with a hoard of
sacred treasures pertaining to her boy. And soon after six,
in the pitiless gold of dawn, the two men cantered leisurely
down to early parade.</p>

<p>Here Desmond's attention was arrested by the absence of
Rajinder Singh. Hailing a lesser native officer, he learnt
that the Ressaldar had been ill with sun-fever all night,
and was still quite unfit for work. Hindus are creatures of
little or no stamina, and they go down like mown grass
before the unhealthy heat of the Frontier.</p>

<p>Desmond despatched a message to the stricken man, adding
that he himself would come to make inquiry before eleven
o'clock. On his return he found Harry temporarily quieter,
and fallen into a light sleep.</p>

<p>"I must see Frank about him," he reflected, "on my way back
from the Lines." For Frank was the regimental standby in
every emergency, and would claim the lion's share of the
nursing as a matter of course.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>
<p>True to his word, Desmond was back on the deserted
parade-ground by half-past ten, his syce pursuing him
closely, a flat paper parcel under his arm. It contained a
full-length photo of himself in the silver frame that had
held his mother's picture, because frames were not to be
procured at an hour's notice in Kohat, and he had a great
wish that his gift should be complete: a lasting
memento&mdash;such as the old Sikh would keenly appreciate&mdash;of
their stirring ride, and of the fact that he owed his life
to the man's remarkable quickness of ear and brain.</p>

<p>Rajinder Singh lived alone; for the Sikh, when he enters
Imperial service, leaves his wife behind in her own village.
His one-roomed hut was saturated with heat, and almost
devoid of light. It contained a chair, a strip of matting,
and a low string-bed, with red cotton quilt and legs of
scarlet lacquer. Mud walls and floor alike were scrupulously
clean. Sacred vessels, for cooking and washing, were stowed
away out of reach of defilement. Above his bed the
simple-hearted soldier had nailed a crude coloured print of
the <i>Kaiser-i-Hind</i> in robes and crown; and on the opposing
wall hung a tawdry looking-glass, almost as dear to his
heart.</p>

<p>The Sirdar was nominally in bed; that is to say, he lay on
the bare strings, beneath his cotton quilt, fully dressed in
loose white tunic and close-fitting trousers. His turban
alone had been discarded, and stood ready-folded beside him,
a miracle of elaborate precision.</p>

<p>At the sound of hoofs he sat up instantly, his uncut hair
and beard flowing down to his waist. In less than twenty
seconds both had been twisted to a deft knot high on the
head, his turban adjusted at an irreproachable angle; and,
as Desmond's figure darkened the doorway, he staggered to
his feet and saluted with a trembling hand.</p>

<p>"Sit down, sit down!" his Captain commanded him; and he
obeyed, rather suddenly, with a rueful smile.</p>

<p>"The years steal away my strength, Hazúr. A little fever,
and my bones become as water&mdash;yea, though I had once the
might of ten in this dried-up arm."</p>

<p>Desmond smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>"No reason to speak evil of the years, after yesterday, and
the fever hath the power of seven devils over any man. I
have been all night beside Denvil Sahib, who lieth without
sense and strength this morning, young as he is."</p>

<p>"Denvil Sahib! I had not known. Is it fever also?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes,&mdash;the great fever. A matter of many weeks, and sore
trouble of mind; for disease takes strong hold upon the
strong. And what will come to the squadron, with both my
troop commanders laid in their beds?"</p>

<p>"<i>Na</i>,&mdash;na, Hazúr. I will arise, even as I am&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That you will not, Sirdar Sahib," Desmond interposed with
kindly decision; "we will rather give Bishan Singh a chance
to prove that he is fit for promotion. I have had the
assurance from him many times in words. Now I will have it
in deeds&mdash;the fittest language for a soldier."</p>

<p>The deep-set eyes gleamed approval.</p>

<p>"Great is the wisdom of the Captain Sahib, understanding the
deceitfulness of man's heart. Bishan Singh's tongue is as a
horse without bit or bridle. If head and hand carry him as
far, he will do well."</p>

<p>"True talk," Desmond answered, smiling. Then with the
incurable diffidence of the Englishman when he is moved to
do a gracious action, he held out his parcel. "See here,
Rajinder Singh. This is a small matter enough for your
acceptance. A token merely that&mdash;I do not forget."</p>

<p>"<i>Hazúr!</i>"</p>

<p>The eagerness of a child transfigured the man's
weatherbeaten face, and his fingers plucked unsteadily at
the string.</p>

<p>Desmond took out a knife and slit it without a word.</p>

<p>For a long moment Rajinder Singh gazed upon the miracle
before him in silent wonder. To the unsophisticated
native&mdash;and there are happily many left in India&mdash;a
photograph remains an abiding miracle; a fact to be accepted
and reverenced without explanation, like the inconsistencies
of the gods.</p>

<p>"In very truth, it is the Captain Sahib himself!" he
muttered with the air of one who makes an amazing discovery.
Then, grasping his possession in both hands, he held it out
at arm's length, examining every detail with loving care;
glancing from the counterfeit to the original as if to
satisfy himself that the artist had omitted nothing; for
Desmond was wearing the undress uniform of the picture.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<p>"<i>Bahut, bahut salaam</i>,
<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Sahib!" he broke out in a
tremulous fervour of gratitude. "It is your Honour's self,
as I said, lacking only speech. Feature for feature&mdash;cord
for cord. All things are faithfully set down. Behold, even
these marks upon the scabbard,&mdash;the very scar upon your
Honour's hand! Now, indeed, hath God favoured me beyond
deserving; for my Captain Sahib abideth under this my roof
until I die."</p>

<p>Rising unsteadily, in defiance of Desmond's mute protest, he
removed the cherished looking-glass, hung the photo in its
place, and, drawing himself up to his full six-feet-two of
height, gravely saluted it.</p>

<p>"<i>Salaam, hamara</i>,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Captain Sahib Bahadur!"</p>

<p>Then he turned to find Desmond, who had risen also, watching
him intently, his full heart in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I thought it would give you pleasure," he said, in a tone
of restrained feeling, "but I had no knowledge that it would
please you as much as that. I am very glad I thought of it.
But now," he added more briskly, "enough of talk. There
waiteth more work to be done than a man can accomplish
before dark. Get you back to bed, Ressaldar Sahib, and stay
there until I order otherwise."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>
<p>Once outside, he sprang to the saddle, and set off at a
canter through the withering, stupefying sunlight towards
Captain Olliver's bungalow.</p>

<h4>YOU DON'T KNOW DESMOND.</h4>

<div class="blockpoem">
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Suffer with men, and like a man be strong."
      &mdash;<span class="smcap">Myers.</span></span><br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank Olliver</span>, looking remarkably fresh and cool in a
holland gown of severe simplicity, greeted him from the
verandah with a flour-covered hand. At the sound of hoofs,
her ready brain had sprung to the right conclusion, and she
hurried out to save him the necessity of dismounting. She
had learned to know the value of minutes to a hard-worked
man.</p>

<p>"Geoff told me," she said, a rare seriousness veiling the
laughter of her eyes. "It's cruel bad news, but you mustn't
dream of being anxious yet awhile, Theo, man. I'll be round
by half-past eleven sharp; stay till you two are through
with your work; rest this afternoon and come on again at
seven, till morning. You'll just take one clear night in bed
before I let you go shares in <i>that</i> part o' the work. You
can trust him to me, can't you, though I <i>am</i> a mad
Irishwoman? I'll promise not to be waking up the patient to
take his sleeping draught, or any such cleverness!"</p>

<p>Her nonsense dispelled Desmond's gravity. "I can trust you
as far as that, I think!" he answered with a laugh; "but I
won't have you knocking yourself up again over this. The
lad's my subaltern, and it's my business. You shall take
to-night, though, if you've a mind to, and my best thanks
into the bargain. God alone knows where we should all be
without you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>
<p>"Just precisely where you are at present, no doubt!" But
the softened tone betrayed her appreciation of his honest
praise. "It's just a bad habit you've got into, that's the
truth, and I've not the heart to break you of it either. But
'tis no time now for playing ball with compliments. I'm busy
over a cake. My cook has a pain, an' swears 'tis cholera.
An' what with dosing him, an' trying to convince him he's a
fool, and seeing after Geoff's tiffin, I'll be melted to one
tear-drop presently; but the good man'll have to dine at
Mess to-night."</p>

<p>Desmond gathered up his reins, and she waved to him as he
rode away.</p>

<p>Punctually at the half-hour she entered the sick-room&mdash;cool,
practised, business-like, and took over her case as
composedly as any trained nurse. For in those early days
nursing was as persistent a feature of the hot weather as
the punkah itself, and her skill had been acquired in a hard
school.</p>

<p>The Boy had been installed, for greater comfort, in
Desmond's own bed; and he greeted her with a faint smile of
recognition.</p>

<p>"Poor, dear old fellow," she murmured tenderly, pushing the
damp hair from his brow; "wait only till the ice comes, an'
we'll pull you round finely, never fear."</p>

<p>His lids fell under her soothing touch, and sprinkling her
fingers with lavender water she passed them across and
across his forehead; a look in her eyes the while that none
save her "brother officers" had ever seen there; a look such
as her children might have seen, had she been so blest.</p>

<p>Among acquaintances Mrs Olliver passed for a masculine
woman, boisterous and good-humoured, though somewhat lacking
in the lesser proprieties and affectations which passed for
delicacy of feeling. But with all her angularity and mannish
ways, she was a fine mother wasted: and in her heart she
knew it. There are too many such among us. A mystery of pain
and unfulfilled hope which there seems no justifying, save
that at times the world is the gainer by their individual
loss; and Frank Olliver, being denied the blessedness of
children, mothered all the men of her regiment, the
formidable Colonel not excepted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<p>Having charmed her patient into a light sleep, she made a
noiseless tour of the room, smiling at the revelation of
Paul Wyndham's hand in the exquisite neatness wherewith all
things had been set in order. A towel pinned to the punkah
frill brought the faint relief of moving air nearer to
Denvil's face. In the hasty manner of its pinning Theo's
workmanship stood revealed, and the smile deepened in her
eyes. She knew each least characteristic of these her grown
children; knew, and loved them, with a strong unspoken love.</p>

<p>Her next move brought her to the thermometer. It registered
95°. A long while after sundown the mercury might drop three
degrees, certainly not more. She cast an anxious glance at
the sleeper, and her quick eye caught the lagging of the
punkah, broken by fitful jerks, which denotes that the
coolie&mdash;squatting on his heels in the verandah&mdash;is pulling
the inexorable rope in his dreams.</p>

<p>Opening the outer door and letting in a blast as from the
mouth of hell, she reasoned with that much-enduring human
machine in a forcible Irish whisper, that set the towel
flapping and billowing like a flag in a wind. The room was
none the cooler for his exertions, but in such intensity of
heat mere movement of the air serves to prevent suffocation.</p>

<p>Mrs Olliver sat down beside her patient and her mind
reverted to her own domestic calamity. She wondered with a
simple practical wonderment, devoid of fear, whether or no
she had a case of cholera in her compound. To-morrow it
would be well to ascertain the truth; and in the meantime
she dismissed the matter from her mind.</p>

<p>Before tiffin was over at the station Mess, Wyndham made his
appearance, and with a friendly nod of welcome took the
reins out of her hands. But by seven o'clock she was back at
her post; and one look at Harry's flushed face and unseeing
eyes convinced her that the next twelve hours would make a
high demand upon her energies, and her resolute hopefulness
of heart.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>
<p>Desmond came in before Mess. His eyes were grave and
anxious, and for many minutes he stood looking down upon the
boy in silence; the slim uprightness of his figure
emphasised by the close-fitting white uniform, with its wide
splash of scarlet at the waist. Then he crossed to the table
and studied the chart, that strange hieroglyph, like a
negative print of forked lightning, so full of dread meaning
to those who can read it aright. The latest entry was 106°.</p>

<p>"You saw Mackay?" he asked, under his breath.</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"You're in for a hard night of it. I'd better stay up and
help."</p>

<p>"I'll not have you at any price," she answered bluntly.</p>

<p>He frowned. But the fact that he did not insist spoke
volumes to her understanding heart.</p>

<p>"Swear you'll send Amar Singh to wake me if it seems
necessary."</p>

<p>"I will&mdash;no fear."</p>

<p>"He'll sit handy, just outside, all night and help you in
any possible way. He's a jewel at times like this. I'll look
in again when I get home."</p>

<p>"Come back early," she commanded with a sudden smile, "and
have a solid night of sleep. It's plain your needing it
badly."</p>

<p>"Thanks. I believe I am. I'll make a fresh start afterwards
and take my fair share of the work. Jove! It's a furnace of
a night. There goes the trumpet; I'll be back before long."</p>

<p>His words were truer than he knew.</p>

<p>Shortly after nine o'clock, while Mrs Olliver was persuading
her semi-delirious patient to swallow two tablespoonfuls of
chicken-broth, quick footsteps and the clink of spurs made
her sit suddenly upright, with a listening look in her eyes.
She knew the country of her service well enough to be
prepared for anything at any hour of the day or night&mdash;and
she was barely surprised when, two minutes later, Desmond
stood before her in his forage cap, his sword buckled on
over his mess-jacket and held high to prevent it from
clanking.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked in a hurried whisper. "A beacon fire
alight?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>
<p>He nodded, and passed a handkerchief across his forehead,
for he had come at lightning speed.</p>

<p>"A raid of sorts&mdash;out Hangu way. Can't tell if it'll be a
big thing or not. The whole garrison's ordered out."</p>

<p>It was a matter of seconds, and he spoke in a breathless
rush.</p>

<p>"I dashed on ahead to give you a few instructions. Olliver
is ordering Griselda to be saddled and brought across at
once. If the affair looks serious we'll send an orderly back
to fetch a doolie from the hospital, come on here for you
and the Boy, and see you safely to the Fort, where you must
stay till further orders. Get all possible necessaries
together, and be ready to leave at a moment's notice."</p>

<p>"If we move him to-night, Theo, 'twill be&mdash;the end of it
all."</p>

<p>A spasm of pain crossed his face.</p>

<p>"I hope to God it mayn't be necessary. But we must take our
chance of that. It won't be safe for you to have a light in
the house, with every door open, and the city full of
<i>budmashes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
Can you manage with just a night-light
carefully screened?"</p>

<p>"Sure I can. I'll manage to see with me fingers well
enough!"</p>

<p>"Right! Amar Singh'll sit outside the door. He'll not sleep
a wink, I promise you."</p>

<p>The suspicion of a tremor in her brave smile caught at his
heart. He pressed her shoulder with a reassuring hand.</p>

<p>"Sorry Olliver couldn't see you before leaving," he said
gently. "Hullo, there's Paul; I must be off. God bless you
for a plucky woman, Frank. We'll all get back&mdash;sometime,
never fear." And in an instant she was alone.</p>

<p>Nothing remained but to blow out the lamp and set the
screened night-light on a table farthest from the outer
doors. Its uncertain flicker served to make darkness visible
and through the darkness she crept back to her station by
the bed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>
<p>Denvil, who had fallen into an unrefreshing sleep, stirred
and tossed with broken mutterings that threatened every
moment to break out into the babble of delirium; and for a
while she sat beside him in a stunned quietness, her ears
strained to catch the sounds that came up from below&mdash;the
hasty gathering of men and horses and mules; the jingle of
harness; brisk words of command; the tramping of many feet.
Comforting sounds, since they spoke of the protective
presence of Englishmen.</p>

<p>But those that followed were less reassuring, for they were
sounds of massed movement, of an organised body under way:
the muffled tread of infantry, the cheerful clatter of
cavalry at the trot. She knew the order of their going, to
the minutest detail. A vision of it all was photographed
upon her brain as she had witnessed it these many times
within the past ten years; and perhaps owing to the mental
vividness of her race, custom had not yet ground the edge
off the poignant moment of departure.</p>

<p>Rapidly, inexorably, the sounds retreated toward the hills;
and as they drew farther away she listened the more
intently. It was as if her spirit, freed from her body,
followed the men she loved, till the unheeding night
absorbed them&mdash;till hearing, stretched to its utmost limit,
could catch no lightest echo of sound.</p>

<p>Then silence, intensified by stifling darkness, enveloped
her, pressing in upon heart and brain like an invisible
force that held her prisoner against her will.</p>

<p>The practical side of her fought squarely against this
obsession of the intangible; but it persisted and prevailed.
The mocking shadows crowded about her, compelled her to a
discomfortable realisation of her solitude in a station
needing the perpetual alertness of armed men to ensure peace
and safety. For Kohat city boasted a creditable average of
bad characters and murder cases&mdash;a corpse more or less on
the Border being of no more consequence than the fall of a
sparrow; and the Waziris had of late been unusually daring
in regard to Government horses and carbines. Nor was it an
unknown thing for them to creep past the sentries on very
black nights into the station itself; and for all her
courage, Frank Olliver was by no means fearless. The two are
a contradiction in terms. Only the unimaginative are
fearless, and only the keenly imaginative, capable of
feeling fear in every fibre, ever scale the heights of true
courage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>
<p>Save for the wakeful vigilance of sentries, the huddled
bungalows of the cantonment lay below her empty as a handful
of shells on a lone shore; and in the overpowering stillness
each least sound stood out crisp and clear-cut as twigs
against a winter sunset; the fitful rustle of bedclothes;
Rob breathing peacefully in a distant corner; the whisper of
the punkah; the querulous creaking of the rope answered by a
whine from the back verandah, where a resigned coolie swayed
a basket of damp straw, packed with bottles of milk and
soda-water for Denvil's consumption during the night.</p>

<p>The reiteration of these still small voices grew distracting
as the whisper of an unseen clock. They dominated the
silence, paralysing thought, and compelling her to note
every change in their pitiless regularity.</p>

<p>Resolved to break the spell by the only definite action
available, she decided to prepare for the emergency which
her brain refused to face. But on rising she was arrested by
a voice from the bed&mdash;a voice not of speech but of song, a
snatch from a burlesque the Boy had played in during the
winter:</p>

<div class="blockpoem">
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">"My name it is Abanazar</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">If you want me you needn't go far;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">I'm sure to be found, if you'll only look round,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Number Seventy, Suddar Bazaar."</span><br />
<br />
</div>

<p>Denvil's deep baritone, distorted to a guttural travesty of
itself, rose to a shout on the ascending notes of the last
line. Then, without pause for breath, came the voice of
speech&mdash;hurried, expressionless, heartrending to hear.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>
<p>"Safe for an encore, that&mdash;what? Should ha' been Desmond,
though. See him in tights you'd think he could slip through
a wedding-ring. Done it too, by Jove! Better than horses
that, in the long-run.&mdash;How about Grey Dawn?&mdash;Confound your
luck! Always a dead cert till I lay anything on. Hold hard,
though.... I'm done with all that now.... Wouldn't go back
on Desmond&mdash;not for a mine of gold. <i>You</i> don't know
Desmond;&mdash;wait till you're in a hole! Eight hundred rupees,
I tell you&mdash;more than his month's pay! Said I was to keep
quiet about it too. Not mail-day to-morrow, is it? Where's
the use of writing to her? She'd never understand. Look
out&mdash;some one's coming,&mdash;there by the door. Great Scott!
It's&mdash;it's mother!"</p>

<p>The voice broke into an unnatural sound between a laugh and
a sob, and Frank, who was already praying for the lesser
evil of silence, bent over the Boy, soothing him with tender
words and tone, as though she were his mother in very deed.</p>

<p>The delusion was strong upon him. He clung to her fiercely
when she would have risen to fetch milk, overwhelming her
with a rush of disjointed questions varied by snatches of
enthusiasm for Desmond, till exhaustion reduced him to
incoherent mutterings; and she was free at last to grope for
milk and brandy and a fresh packing of wet sheets.</p>

<p>He grew quieter after a space, and sank into a more restful
sleep, leaving Frank Olliver to face another spell of
whispering silence; her ears strained now to catch the dread
sound of a single horseman returning from the hills.</p>

<p>The first white streak of dawn found her still at her post,
with hands quietly folded and unclosed eyes; found Amar
Singh wide-eyed also, his lean face and figure rigid as a
stone image, a bared sword lying like a flash of light
across his knees.</p>

<p>And with the dawn came also the far-off mutter of the
footsteps that night had stolen from her; an inverted
repetition of the same sounds in a steady crescendo that
rang like music in her ears&mdash;a sound to lift the heart.</p>

<p>The massed tramping of men and horses broke up at length,
scattered in all directions, and within five minutes she
looked up to find her husband in the doorway&mdash;a thickset
man, with more of force than perception in his blunt
features and heavily-browed eyes.</p>

<p>She rose and went to him straightway, her face alight with
satisfaction, and he took a friendly hold of her arm by way
of greeting. They had always been more like good comrades
than man and wife, these two.</p>

<p>"Well, old girl," he said, "there was no show after all, you
see. It seems that the raid didn't quite come off; and we
had our scamper for nothing, worse luck! The Boy going on
all right?"</p>

<p>"'Tis hard to tell. He's in a quiet sleep just now, anyway."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>
<p>"You may as well come out of this, then, and give us some
breakfast. I'm going to the Major's room to tidy up."</p>

<p>As his wife stepped back into the sick-room, Theo Desmond
came quickly towards her.</p>

<p>"Well done," he said heartily; "you didn't expect us quite
so soon, did you? Not a shot fired, and I should have been
swearing all the way home&mdash;but for the Boy. Looks peaceful
enough now, doesn't he? Temperature any lower?"</p>

<p>"Just a little, these last few hours. But he's been talking
a deal of madness, poor fellow."</p>

<p>"What about?" he asked sharply. "Money?"</p>

<p>She smiled, with an odd mixture of pride and tenderness in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Faith, I can see what's been happening, Theo, clear as
daylight. But I'll say no word to a soul, not even Geoff;
you know that sure enough."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it. But I'll feel grateful when he stops airing
the subject."</p>

<p>Her low laugh had a break in it, and he scanned her face
keenly.</p>

<p>"You're played out, Frank. I was afraid you were hardly fit
for this sort of thing yet. You don't do a stroke more till
to-morrow morning. Come along now and have five grains of
quinine and some food. Amar Singh can mount guard in case
the Boy wakes up."</p>

<p>Paul Wyndham greeted her with his nod and smile, which were
apt to convey more friendliness than other people's words.
Desmond set her ceremoniously in the place of honour; and
the 6.30 breakfast, prepared at ten minutes' notice, and
eaten in Mess uniform, proved a remarkably cheerful affair;
one of those simple, commonplace events which, for all their
simplicity, go far to cement friendship and form refreshing
cases along the dusty path of life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>
<p>The morning post-bag contained an envelope in Evelyn's
handwriting; and, the Ollivers being gone, Theo retired to
the study to enjoy it at his leisure. It proved to be short,
and contained little beyond querulous upbraiding. Her
husband could almost catch the tone of her voice as he read;
and the light of satisfaction left his face. Evelyn had an
insatiable appetite for long and detailed letters, though
she by no means returned them in kind; and it appeared that
Theo had not written for a week. In the fulness of his days
he had not realised the fact which was now brought forcibly
to his notice.</p>

<p>"It's just laziness and selfishness," she wrote in her
sweeping fashion, "when you <i>know</i> how I look out for your
letters, to leave me a whole week without a line. If it was
<i>me</i>, there might be some excuse, because there's always
something or another going on, and I never seem to get a
minute to sit down and write. But you must have hours and
hours of spare time in the long days down there. I expect
you play chess with Major Wyndham all the while, and quite
forget about writing to me. I suppose if you were ill <i>some
one</i> would have the decency to write and tell me. But if you
don't write yourself <i>directly</i> you get this, I shall think
something dreadful has happened; and it's such a nuisance
not to know if you are all right. I can't enjoy things
properly a bit."</p>

<p>And so on, <i>ad lib.</i>, <i>da capo</i>, until the end.</p>

<p>Having read it through twice, with a flicker of amusement in
his tired eyes, he sat down straightway, wrote for a quarter
of an hour at the top of his speed, and left the letter
ready for the afternoon post. It contained a polite apology
for remissness, followed by an account in bare outline of
his doings during the past five days; a few details in
regard to Harry's illness; and an intimation that if letters
were short, she must remember that, for the present, every
hour of spare time would be taken up with nursing the Boy or
writing detailed accounts to his mother. And, in truth,
before that wearisome illness was over Mrs[.] Denvil and her
boy's Captain had struck up a lasting friendship across six
thousand miles of sea.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On her return from a tennis party the following afternoon
Evelyn Desmond found the letter awaiting her; and her face
took such rueful lines as she read it, that Honor's anxiety
was roused.</p>

<p>"<i>Evelyn</i>&mdash;what is it?" she asked, a slight catch in her
breath.</p>

<p>Evelyn shrugged her shoulders in meek resignation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, it's only rather more Kohatish than usual! Mr. Denvil
seems to be quite bad with typhoid, and Theo has been
galloping over half the Frontier after outposts&mdash;such
rubbishy work for a man like that! And&mdash;oh, you'd better
read it all for yourself. You needn't bother about it having
been written for <i>me</i>. It might just as well be a paragraph
out of a newspaper!"</p>

<p>With a childish grimace she tossed the letter across the
table. But hid in her heart lay the rankling knowledge that
she had been both hasty and unjust to her husband, who had
emphasised the fact by ignoring it,&mdash;a method peculiarly his
own.</p>

<p>Honor read every line of the closely-written pages with
eager interest, read also the much that had not been
written, that Evelyn had failed to discern; and a great
thankfulness overwhelmed her that she had refrained from
adding her own passing vexation to the burden of work and
anxiety already resting on her friend's shoulders.</p>

<p>Her spoken comment was brief and characteristic.</p>

<p>"Oh, how I envy Mrs Olliver! We're just playing at life up
here, you and I, like two dolls, while she is living the
real thing down there."</p>

<p>Evelyn Desmond, in utter astonishment, flung annoyance to
the winds.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>
<p>"Really and truly, Honor," she declared, with conviction,
"you are the most amazing person I've ever known!"</p>

<h4>NOW IT'S DIFFERENT.</h4>

<div class="blockpoem">
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">"A word! how it severeth!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">O Power of Life and Death,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">In the tongue, as the preacher saith."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 21.5em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Browning.</span></span><br />
<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great monsoon&mdash;a majestic onrush of cloud hurtling
across the heavens, with dazzle of lightning and clangour of
thunder&mdash;had long since rolled up from India's coastline to
her utmost hills; bringing new forms of torment to the
patient plains; filling mountain and valley and
water-courses innumerable with the voice of melody.</p>

<p>On the cedar-crowned heights of Murree, dank boughs dripped
and drooped above ill-made houses, that gave free admittance
to the moist outer world; tree ferns, springing to sudden
life on moss-clad trunks and boughs, showed brilliant as
emeralds on velvet. The whole earth was quick with hidden
stirrings and strivings, the whole air quick with living
sound&mdash;plash of rain-drops; evensong of birds; glad shouting
of cicadas among the branches, and the laughter of a hundred
fairy falls.</p>

<p>Theo Desmond drank in the cool green wonder of it all with a
keenly perceptive enjoyment; drew into his lungs deep
draughts of the strong, clean mountain air; watched the
frail curtain of mist swaying, lifting, spreading to a
pearl-white film, till, through a sudden rent, the red gold
of sunset burned, deepening to a mass of velvet shadow the
inexpressible blue of rain-washed hills.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>
<p>His post of observation on this August evening was the
saturated verandah of "The Deodars," where he had flung
himself full length in Honor's canvas chair, a pipe between
his teeth; hands locked behind his head; lavishly muddied
boots and gaiters outstretched; the whole supple length of
him eloquent of well-earned relaxation and repose.</p>

<p>Three days earlier he had ridden up through a world of
driving mist and rain in the wake of Harry Denvil's doolie;
having secured a blessed month of respite for himself and
two months for the Boy, who, by the efforts of three
tireless nurses and a redoubtable Scotch doctor, had been
dragged back from death; and was but just beginning to take
hold on life and health again.</p>

<p>From outset to close he had clung to the support of
Desmond's presence with the tenacity of an exhausted body
and a fevered brain;&mdash;a tenacity which could not fail to
touch the older man's heart, and which had made it difficult
for others to take their due share in the nursing. Thus the
slow weeks of dependence on one side, and unwearied service
on the other, together with the underlying bond between
them, had wrought a closeness of friendship to which the Boy
had long aspired; and which promised to add depth and
stability to the warmth and uprightness of heart that were
already his. Harry Denvil's present need was for a tacit
wiping out of the past, an unquestioning trust in regard to
the future; and his Captain, after the wordless manner of
men, gave him full assurance of both. It is just this power
to draw out the best and strongest by the simple habit of
taking it for granted that marks the true leader; the man
who compels because he never insists; whose influence is
less a force than a subtle radiation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>
<p>And now, as Theo Desmond sat alone fronting a world compact
of mist and fire, and the fragrance of moist earth, his mind
was mainly concerned with the Boy's future, and with certain
retrenchments of his own expenditure, whereby alone he could
hope to cancel the debts that remained after the disposal of
Roland. His sole trouble in respect of these retrenchments
lay in the fact that they must, to some extent, affect his
wife. If only she could be persuaded to see the necessity as
clearly as he did himself, all would be well. She and Harry
had been good friends from the outset. He hoped&mdash;he
believed&mdash;she would understand.</p>

<p>Light footsteps on the boards behind him brought a smile to
his lips; but he neither turned nor stirred. An instant
later, hands cool and imponderable as snowflakes rested on
his forehead, and silken strands of hair brushed it softly
as his wife leaned over him, nestling her head against his
own.</p>

<p>"Are you very happy sitting there?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Supremely happy."</p>

<p>"Why? Because you're so nice and wet, and messy?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and a few other reasons as well."</p>

<p>"What other reasons? Me?"</p>

<p>"Naturally, you dear little goose! Come round and let me get
a sight of you, instead of perching behind me like a bird."</p>

<p>She came round obediently, standing a little away from
him,&mdash;a slim strip of colour that reflected the uncertain
sea-tint of her eyes,&mdash;and looked down upon his disordered
appearance with a small grimace.</p>

<p>"I'm not <i>sure</i> that I love you properly, Theo, when you're
<i>quite</i> as muddy as that."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you do; come on!"</p>

<p>And putting out an arm, he drew her down till she knelt
beside him, her hands resting on his knee. He covered them
quietly with one of his own.</p>

<p>"Ladybird, it's turning out a glorious evening! Come for a
walk."</p>

<p>"Oh, Theo, <i>don't</i> be so uncomfortably energetic! I hate
going out in the wet. You only came in half an hour ago, and
you've been walking all day."</p>

<p>He laughed&mdash;the glad laugh of a truant schoolboy&mdash;and
knocked the ashes out of his pipe.</p>

<p>"I'm capable of walking all night too! Only then you might
imagine the hot weather had turned my brain. But indeed,
little woman, if you had been sickened with sunlight and
scorched earth as I have been for the last three months,
you'd understand how a man may feel a bit lightheaded in the
first few days that he's quit of it all."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>
<p>"And was I very horrid to be playing up here in the cool
all the time?" she asked, pricked by the memory of Honor's
words to one of her rare touches of compunction.</p>

<p>"My dear, what nonsense! It would have been double as bad if
you had been there too."</p>

<p>Sincerity rang in his tone, and she noted the fact with a
sigh of relief. She was not altogether heartless, this
fragile slip of womanhood. She merely desired, like many of
us, the comfort of being selfish without the unbecomingness
of appearing so.</p>

<p>"We'll sit out here together and talk till it gets dark,"
she announced with a pretty air of decision, lest the
invitation to walk should be renewed. "Stay where you are,
and I'll fetch a stool. It's quite a treat to see you
looking lazy for once in a way."</p>

<p>She brought a stool and established herself close to him. He
acknowledged her presence without removing his eyes from the
storm-tossed glory of the sky.</p>

<p>"Look, Ladybird&mdash;look!" he urged in a low tone. "We can talk
afterwards."</p>

<p>But her attention was caught and riveted by the reflection
of the glory in her husband's face.</p>

<p>"Does it please you so tremendously?" she asked in honest
bewilderment. "Just a sunset! You've seen hundreds of them
before."</p>

<p>He smiled and answered nothing. Speech and emotion inhabit
different hemispheres of a man's brain; woman alone is rash
enough to force them into unwilling union.</p>

<p>The clinging garment of mist, driven and dispersed by day's
last flash of self-assertion, lay heaped and tumbled in the
valleys, and the mountains stood knee-deep in an opalescent
sea of foam. It was as though Nature, in a mood of
capricious kindliness, had rent the veil, that mortals might
share in the triumphal passing of the sun, whose supremacy
had been in eclipse these many days.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<p>Above the deep-toned quiet of earth, blurred and ragged
clouds showed every conceivable tone of umber and grey, from
purest pearl-white to darkest depths of indigo. Only low
down, where a blue-black mass ended with level abruptness, a
flaming strip of day was splashed along the west&mdash;one broad
brush-stroke, as it were, by some Titanic artist whose
palette held liquid fire. Snows and mist alike caught and
flung back the radiance in a maze of rainbow hues; while
beyond the bank of cloud a vast pale fan of light shot
outward and upward to the very zenith of heaven. Each
passing minute wrought some imperceptible change of
grouping, form, or colour; blurred masses melted to flakes
and strata on a groundwork of frail blue; orange deepened to
crimson; and anon earth and sky were on fire with tints of
garnet and rose. Each several snow-peak blushed like an
angel surprised in a good deed. Splashes of colour sprang
from cloud-tip to cloud-tip with invisible speed, till even
the chill east glowed with a faint hue of life.</p>

<p>And in the midst of the transient splendour, enveloped by
the isolation of the falling day, husband and wife sat
silent, absorbed in strangely opposite reflections. Verily
they dwelt in different planets, these two who had willed to
be one, but whom forces more potent held it inexorably
apart.</p>

<p>Desmond had long since passed beyond the border-line of
definite thought; while Evelyn's mind rapidly reverted to
the more congenial atmosphere of things terrestrial. An
unknown force was urging her to speak openly to her husband,
to rid herself of the shadow that had begun to tarnish the
bright surface of life. It would be easier to speak in dusk
than in bald daylight&mdash;easier also before the bloom of
reunion had been rubbed off by the prosaic trivialities of
life. In her present position, too, it would be possible to
avoid his gaze; and she found a singular difficulty in
tampering with facts when Theo's eyes were on her face.</p>

<p>She watched him speculatively for a few moments, and
wondered what change would come over him when her tale was
told. Anger frightened and repelled her; and for all his
hastiness she had seldom seen more than a mere spark of his
inner fire.</p>

<p>He seemed to have forgotten her existence; and by way of
gentle reminder she shifted her position.</p>

<p>"Theo," she said under her breath.</p>

<p>He felt the movement without catching the sound of his name,
and turned to her quickly, impulsive speech upon his lips.</p>

<p>"By the way, Ladybird, there's something I want to tell you,
and this is a good opportunity."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>
<p>The coincidence so startled her that her own half-fledged
impulse scurried back to its nest. Nor was she certain
whether the sigh that escaped her expressed disappointment
or relief.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked&mdash;"something nice?"</p>

<p>The characteristic question set him smiling.</p>

<p>"You must judge for yourself. It chiefly concerns the Boy.
You're fond of him, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he's nice enough. But why?"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't mind if we put ourselves out a little to get
him out of a difficulty?"</p>

<p>"Well, that would rather depend on what we had to do." Her
tone, though still pleasant, was guarded. "What kind of
difficulty?"</p>

<p>"Money."</p>

<p>She turned her face away something suddenly, and felt very
thankful that day was fading from the sky.</p>

<p>"Do you mean&mdash;lending him money?" she asked blankly.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;giving it. I prefer it that way. There's no need to
tell you his troubles in detail; it would hardly be fair to
him. They, are of a kind you can't know anything about; and
I hope you never will."</p>

<p>In the fewest possible words he gave her an outline of
Harry's story; of the parting with Roland, and the promise
he had exacted in return for his help. He spoke throughout
with such unfailing kindness that vexation pricked and stung
her, like thorns under the skin. She might have told him
after all. He would not have been angry. Now she had been
forestalled. She failed to perceive that the backslidings of
his wife must of necessity touch him more nearly than those
of his subaltern, and that to her own extravagance was added
a host of petty evasions and deceits such as a man of his
type would be little able to condone or understand.</p>

<p>"You see," he was saying when her mind harked back from the
excursion into her own point of view, "the poor fellow has
done all he can towards putting matters straight, and I am
thankful I can manage the rest myself, so as to give him a
fair start for the future."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>
<p>"But how much is&mdash;<i>your</i> share?" she asked, almost in a
whisper.</p>

<p>"Rather more than eight hundred rupees."</p>

<p>"And you have actually&mdash;<i>done</i> it, Theo?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You surely couldn't have wished otherwise?"</p>

<p>For a moment she hesitated, then her repressed bitterness
brimmed over.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. Only I think you might have considered
<i>me</i> a little first. I've more right to your money than he
has; and if you can afford to throw away eight hundred
rupees on a careless, extravagant subaltern, you could quite
well let me go to Simla; or at least add something to my
dress allowance. It's not so very easy to manage on the
little you give me."</p>

<p>She spoke with averted face in a tone of clear hardness, and
each word smote her husband like a small sharp stone.</p>

<p>"I am sorry you see it that way," he said, a new restraint
in his voice, "and that you don't find your allowance
sufficient. I give you all I can, and you seem to have
pretty frocks enough, anyhow. If I had eight hundred rupees
to throw away,&mdash;as you choose to express it,&mdash;I should
hardly have spoken of putting ourselves out; in fact, I
shouldn't have spoken at all. But you have been such good
friends with the Boy all along that I hoped you would be
ready to help give him a hand up. I can only manage such a
sum by knocking two hundred off my pay for the next four
months. This means cutting down expenses a little; but we
can easily do it, Ladybird&mdash;<i>if</i> we pull together."</p>

<p>At any other time such an appeal from Theo would have proved
irresistible, would have drawn them into a closer union of
thought and purpose than they had ever attained as yet. But
the appeal came at the wrong moment, and Evelyn Desmond sat
silent, her hands so fast interlocked that her rings bruised
their delicate surface.</p>

<p>"I am thinking of the Boy's mother as well as himself, you
see," her husband urged with increasing gentleness; "he is
her only son, and she is wrapped up in him; and I know from
experience what that means."</p>

<p>She lifted her head and faced him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>
<p>"You think a great deal too much about&mdash;those sort of stray
people, Theo, and it's rather hard on me. Why am <i>I</i> to be
made uncomfortable on account of Mrs Denvil, when I've never
even met her in my life?"</p>

<p>"If you can't see that for yourself, Ladybird, I'm afraid I
can't tell you. I've no taste for preaching sermons."</p>

<p>"It would be rather a mercy if you had no taste for acting
them either," she retorted, with a little laugh that failed
to take the edge off her words. "<i>I</i> don't much like them in
any form. How are you going to cut down expenses?"</p>

<p>"Chiefly in ways that need not concern you. But to start
with, I'm afraid I must take you and Honor down with me on
the third of next month. I can do nothing while I am
crippled by a double establishment. You'll barely miss four
weeks up here, and the heat is over earlier in Kohat than in
the Punjab. Paul gets his leave when mine is up, and he will
spend it here with the Boy, so as to take the last month of
rent off my hands."</p>

<p>"So you've <i>settled</i> it all without saying a word to <i>me</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I had to fix things up before I left. It's a pity the
difficulty includes Honor, but I don't think she'll mind
when I tell her why."</p>

<p>"Oh dear, no; <i>Honor</i> won't mind. I believe she's happier in
Kohat,&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But <i>you</i> are <i>not</i>?" he broke out abruptly, leaning
forward and searching her face with anxious eyes.</p>

<p>The vehement question startled her.</p>

<p>"I never said <i>that</i>, Theo&mdash;and it isn't true. Only&mdash;I do
hate the ugliness and the heat, and September's the
loveliest month of all up here."</p>

<p>"Doesn't it make things any easier to feel you are helping
the Boy by giving up these few weeks of enjoyment?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;it doesn't. Not a bit."</p>

<p>Desmond frowned.</p>

<p>"Try and fancy yourself in a strait like that, Evelyn, and
the thundering relief it would be to get out of it."</p>

<p>His words stabbed her unwittingly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>
<p>"I'm not good at fancying things, and I'm not good at
cutting down expenses either&mdash;I was never taught. I hope you
don't do these uncomfortable sort of things often, Theo. It
seems to me you're too much inclined to rush in and help
people without stopping to think of&mdash;of other people at all!
It would have been much better for the Boy if you'd left him
to get clear of his muddle, instead of upsetting every one
by spending money on him that you can't really spare."</p>

<p>Her husband leaned farther back into the shadow, his mouth
hardened to a rigid line. All that he chose to say on the
subject had been said.</p>

<p>Emboldened by his silence, and the fact that his face was
hidden from her, she continued her small flow of
remonstrance, undermining herself more completely with each
fresh word.</p>

<p>"It was all very well while you were a bachelor for you to
go throwing your life and your money about so foolishly. But
now it's different; and I don't think you have a right to do
it any more. Where's the good of us trying so hard to live
on our pay, if it's only to be flung about to help
subalterns who don't try at all? You can't cure Mr Denvil of
being casual; and for all your generosity, you'll probably
find him in just as bad a hole again by this time next
year."</p>

<p>The words stung him to sharp retort.</p>

<p>"I never asked for <i>your</i> opinion of the Boy, Evelyn; and
you seem to forget that he has given me his word."</p>

<p>"Oh, no doubt he has! It's easy enough to make promises when
one's unhappy; but it isn't so easy to keep them when things
get smooth again." And she nodded her head wisely, for her
conviction sprang from the depths of personal experience.</p>

<p>Her husband rose and walked to the verandah's edge. Here he
remained standing, his hands thrust deep into the pockets of
his Norfolk coat, his eyes fixed absently on the last gleam
of light in the west, where all that now remained of the
sunset's stormy splendour was a handful of filmy fragments,
like rose petals dropped from some Olympian rose-bush, and
the sickle of a young moon, outrivalled by the mellow
radiance of the evening star. The snows lay dead and cold,
awaiting the resurrection of dawn. Their chill pallor struck
at his heart in a manner new to him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>
<p>Evelyn studied his eloquent outline with a mild surprise.
She was not a little proud of her valiant protest against
his mistaken ideas; and he was surely not foolish enough to
be annoyed because she had talked practical commonsense.</p>

<p>She went to him at last, and lightly touched his arm.</p>

<p>"You look as solemn as a funeral, Theo! Why don't you
speak?"</p>

<p>"Because I have no more to say. Too much has been said
already. I am sorry I mentioned the matter at all."</p>

<p>With that he turned from her and entered the house.</p>

<p>Honor met him on the threshold, and her eyes were quick to
catch the lurking shadow in his. But she merely said what
she had come to say.</p>

<p>"Mr Denvil is longing for you. I have done my small best to
amuse him; only there comes a stage when nothing will
satisfy him but you. Where's Evelyn?"</p>

<p>"Outside there. It's time she came in."</p>

<p>Honor found her by the verandah rails, standing like a
pensive ghost in the dying light.</p>

<p>"Studying the sunset, Evelyn?" she remarked cheerfully.
"That's a new departure for you!"</p>

<p>Whereat Evelyn flung out both hands&mdash;a pretty appealing
gesture all her own.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, Honor, Theo's been <i>so</i> troublesome! And he wants to
take us down on the third of next month. He will explain to
you the why of it all; perhaps you'll understand better than
I could. Such high-flown notions don't appeal to me a bit.
<i>I</i> think Theo is rather like that silly man in the Middle
Ages who was always trying to fight windmills, or sheep, or
something; and there really ought to be a law to prevent
people who want to go about being unselfish to everybody
from ever having wives at all!"</p>

<h4>IT ISN'T FAIR.</h4>

<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">To him who bears the strong offence's cross."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19.5em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span></span><br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> measure of a man's worth is not to be found in a heroic
impulse or a fine idea, but in the steadfast working out of
either through weeks and months&mdash;when the glow has faded
from the heights, when the inspiration of an illumined
moment has passed into the unrecognised chivalry of daily
life; and the three months following upon that crucial
August evening put no light tax upon Desmond's staying
power,&mdash;the power that is the corner-stone of all
achievement.</p>

<p>Border life is, in every respect, more costly than life in
"down country" cantonments. To keep within the narrow bounds
of his pay was already a difficult matter; and such minor
retrenchments as could be achieved were inadequate to meet
his present need. He saw that he would be called upon to
part with one or two cherished possessions, acquired in days
of young extravagance; and possibly to break into the few
hundred rupees laid aside for emergencies shortly after his
marriage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>
<p>Wine, cigars, and cigarettes must be banished outright; and
he limited himself to one pipe and one "peg" a-day. Stores
of all kinds were ruthlessly cut down; and only the
Anglo-Indian housewife knows what it means to be flung
almost entirely upon the tender mercies of the Bazaar.
Informal dinner-parties, for which the Desmonds were famous,
became rare events; and nights at Mess&mdash;a favourite and
justifiable luxury&mdash;were reduced in number as far as might
be without eliciting remonstrance from his brother officers.
For in India, and more especially in the Army of India, it
is profoundly true that "no man liveth unto himself." In the
Land of the Open Door the second of the two great
commandments is apt to be set before the first; and nowhere,
perhaps, is the bond of union stronger, more compelling,
than in the isolated regiments of the Frontier Force. But,
with due regard for this unwritten law, Desmond accomplished
much in those few months of unremitting self-denial; and if
his friends noted certain changes in his way of life, they
accepted these in the true spirit of comradeship, without
question or comment.</p>

<p>Even Wyndham kept silence, though he had fuller knowledge of
his friend's abstemiousness, and was disturbed by a great
longing to remove the hidden cause. But intimate speech
played a minor part in the friendship of these two men. The
very depth and strength of their feeling for each other
constrained them to a particular reticence in the matter of
self-expression.</p>

<p>On the first occasion of Paul's dining at the blue bungalow,
after his return from Murree, Desmond spoke a few words of
apology for the absence of wine and cigars.</p>

<p>"Sorry to treat you shabbily, old man," he said, when they
were alone. "Just a little necessary economy. It won't last
long."</p>

<p>Paul nodded, smiling, and quietly proffered his own
cigar-case.</p>

<p>"At least you'll not refuse one of mine, Theo," he said; and
their talk drifted into the fertile channel of "shop," and
the prospect of serious collision with Russia, which at that
time loomed on the political horizon.</p>

<p>Paul was thus left to draw his own conclusions, which were
not complimentary to his friend's wife. For reserve has its
drawbacks, like every other virtue; and those who practise
it often, forget that if there is a time for silence, there
is also a time for speech.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>
<p>Evelyn clung tenaciously to her disapproval of the whole
proceeding. The scarcity of stores, and of pleasant little
dinners, were the only retrenchments that directly disturbed
her comfort, and she made the most of them, though the
problems of housekeeping fell mainly upon Honor's shoulders.
The girl's readiness to accept Evelyn's burden, as a matter
of course, could not fail to rouse Desmond's admiration: and
these three months of friction and stress, of working
bravely together for one end, went far to strengthen the
bond of their friendship.</p>

<p>Evelyn contented herself with a thinly veiled air of
martyrdom, and with raising objections whenever opportunity
offered. Only after Denvil's first dinner did she venture a
direct attack. For on this occasion economy was not. Wine
and cigars appeared with the dessert; and the two men sat an
inordinately long while over both. But the inner
significance of her husband's acts being a sealed book to
Evelyn Desmond, she spent the evening in a state of
suppressed irritation, which, on the Boy's departure,
overflowed in petulant reproof.</p>

<p>"Why did you have everything different to-night just because
of Mr Denvil?" she demanded in a note of challenge.</p>

<p>"Because I preferred it so."</p>

<p>Desmond's tone was polite, but final. He sat down and opened
a book in self-defence. But Evelyn was not to be baulked by
a policy of masterly inactivity. She remained standing
before him.</p>

<p>"Is it going to be like that every time he comes?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Theo&mdash;it's perfectly ridiculous the way you put yourself
out for that boy!" she protested with unusual heat, kindled
by a hidden spark of jealousy. "It's bad enough to have you
giving up everything, and making Honor and me thoroughly
uncomfortable, without this sort of nonsense on the top of
it all."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>
<p>Honor glanced up in quick remonstrance; but Desmond caught
the look in her eyes, and it was enough. "Haven't you the
sense to see that just because he is so fond of you he
<i>ought</i> to be allowed to know how much trouble he has given
you. It's the only way to make him more careful, now he's
back again; and if you <i>will</i> go on in this way, I shall end
in speaking to him myself."</p>

<p>She had overshot the mark.</p>

<p>Desmond shut the book with a snap; flung it on the table,
and sprang up with such anger in his eyes that his wife
shrank back instinctively. Her movement, slight as it was,
checked the impetuous speech upon his lips.</p>

<p>"You will do nothing of the sort," he said in a restrained
voice. "It is a matter entirely between him and me; and
that's an end of the subject, once for all."</p>

<p>Evelyn, startled into silence, stood motionless till the
study door closed behind her husband; then, with a sigh of
exasperation, hurried out of the room, leaving Honor to her
own disturbing thoughts.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Each month was forcing upon the girl a clearer revelation of
the clash of temperament, which threatened to bring about
serious disunion between these two, whose happiness had
become a vital part of her life; and her spirit was troubled
beyond measure. The strongest passion of Honor Meredith's
heart was the true woman's passion&mdash;to protect and help. But
worldly wisdom warned her that her hands were tied; that man
and wife must work out their own salvation, or the reverse,
without help or hindrance from her.</p>

<p>Since their return from Murree such flashes of dissension
had become increasingly frequent between them. It is
astonishing how quickly two people can fall into a habit of
discord. Abstinence from tobacco was not without its effect
upon Desmond's nerves and temper, tried as they were by
Evelyn's pin-prick methods of warfare; while she herself was
often strung into irritability by her own unacknowledged
troubles.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>
<p>The passing relief wrought by Miss Kresney's loan had
evaporated with the realisation that she had only contracted
a debt in another direction&mdash;a debt more embarrassing than
all the rest put together; for she knew that she would never
have the courage to speak of it to her husband. Miss Kresney
had told her to take her time in the matter of repayment,
and she had taken it in generous measure. Not a fraction of
the three hundred rupees had been repaid as yet; and, by way
of atonement, Evelyn felt constrained to a more decisive
friendliness with both brother and sister&mdash;a fact which Owen
Kresney noted with satisfaction; and which did not improve
matters between herself and Theo.</p>

<p>As the weeks wore on he devoted his spare time more
exclusively to polo and Persian; continuing his lessons to
Honor; and rarely spending his evenings in the drawing-room,
unless the girl's music held him spellbound, and ensured the
avoidance of dangerous topics. Evelyn retorted by a renewed
zest for tennis and tea-parties; an increasing tendency to
follow the line of least resistance, regardless of results.
Thus Honor found herself thrown more and more upon the
companionship of Mrs Olliver, Mrs Conolly, and Paul Wyndham,
whose anxiety for Theo she guessed at, even as they guessed
her own, though never a word on the subject passed between
them.</p>

<p>Evelyn's anxiety was reserved exclusively for herself. She
had sense enough to perceive that nothing could defer the
day of reckoning much longer; and on a certain afternoon in
early December she exhumed her detested sheaf of bills and
sat down at her bureau to a reconsideration of the
hopelessness of things in general.</p>

<p>A panel of winter sunshine, flung across the room from the
verandah door, enveloped her in a glow of light and warmth.
The drowsiness of an Indian noon brooded over the compound.
Honor was out riding with Paul Wyndham; Theo busy in the
next room, and very unlikely to interrupt her, she reflected
with a pang of regret. In an hour's time she was going over
to tea and tennis with the Kresneys; and had decided that,
after six months of silence, some mention must be made of a
fixed scale of repayment, to begin with the New Year. But in
that event, what hope of meeting any of those other demands,
that were again being urgently brought to her notice? What
possibility of ordering the two new gowns&mdash;bare necessities,
in her esteem&mdash;to grace the coming Christmas week at Lahore?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>
<p>This same "week" is the central social event of the Punjab
cold weather, when most officers on the Border are certain
of their fifteen days' leave; when from all corners of the
Province men and women gravitate towards its dusty
capital&mdash;women with dress baskets of formidable size; men
armed with polo-sticks, and with ponies, beloved
cricket-bats and saddles!</p>

<p>Through all the dismal coil of things, this one hour of
festivity gleamed on Evelyn Desmond's horizon like a light
in a dark room. For one brief blessed week she would be in
her element, would escape from the galling restraint of
economy; and, more than all, in the background of her mind
there lurked a hope that by some means she might recapture
that vigorous, self-poised husband of hers, whose love was,
after all, the one real necessity of her life; and whom she
now saw slipping slowly, surely out of reach. But to
recapture she must recaptivate; and to that end faultless
frocks were indispensable.</p>

<p>She leaned her head upon her hands, and fell to building
extravagant air-castles that eclipsed all practical
considerations whatsoever.</p>

<p>So complete was her abstraction, that she failed to hear the
study door open, and was rudely startled back to reality by
her husband's voice at her elbow, sharp and stern, as she
had never heard it till now.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the meaning of this, Evelyn?" he demanded,
bringing his hand down on the desk beside her; and one
glance at the half sheet lying beneath it was enough. That
particular bill had grown painfully familiar during the last
few months. It was from Lahore, and its total was no less
than three hundred rupees. Her husband's waiting silence was
more disconcerting than speech.</p>

<p>"It's mine," she murmured breathlessly; and snatched at the
offending scrap of paper, tearing it in two.</p>

<p>"The bill is mine now," Desmond rebuked her with studied
equanimity. "You can't cancel it by destroying it. No doubt
you've got another copy. Will you let me have it and any
others you happen to have by you?"</p>

<p>"Where's the use of that?... You can't pay off anything
now."</p>

<p>"I can and will pay off every penny. But I must know exactly
how you stand."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>
<p>For all his coldness, the assurance fell on her heart like
rain on thirsty soil. Where the money was to come from she
could not guess. But she knew enough of the man to feel sure
that his words would be fulfilled to the letter.</p>

<p>One consideration only withheld her from reply. How much did
she dare confess to him even now? Not Miss Kresney's
transaction; nor the need of new dresses for Lahore. But the
rest!... What an unspeakable comfort it would be to fling
all the rest on to his shoulders, that seemed broad and
strong enough to carry her burdens and his own.</p>

<p>Her hesitancy pricked him to impatience.</p>

<p>"Well, Evelyn, I am waiting for your answer. Are there other
bills besides that one?&mdash;Yes or No. I want the truth. Don't
stop to embroider it."</p>

<p>At that the blood flew to her cheeks. She sprang up and
faced him, tremulous, but defiant.</p>

<p>"If you say things like <i>that</i> to me, I won't tell you
anything at all ... ever." And turning sharply away, to hide
her tears, she went over to the mantelpiece and leaned upon
it, keeping her back towards him.</p>

<p>Desmond followed her.</p>

<p>"I am sorry if I hurt you," he said, a touch of bitterness
in his tone. "But the fact that I can speak so without doing
you a gross injustice hurts me more than you are ever likely
to understand."</p>

<p>"You make it all seem much worse&mdash;than it really is," she
answered without looking round. "I haven't done anything
dreadful, after all. Heaps of people get into debt. You
weren't so angry with Mr Denvil; and&mdash;and&mdash;if you hadn't
been in such a hurry to help him, you'd have found it easier
to help me now."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>
<p>"No need to fling that in my teeth, or drag the Boy into
the discussion. The cases are not parallel, and you have
only yourself to thank that my money went to him instead of
you. In my anxiety to avoid anything of this sort, I have
questioned you several times, and each time you have told me
a lie. The whole pile of bills are nothing to me in
comparison with that. I suppose I ought to have known that
you could hardly dress as you do on the little I can spare.
But I was fool enough to trust you implicitly." He paused,
and added with greater gentleness: "What's more, I shall
trust you again, unless you make that quite impossible. But
I warn you&mdash;Ladybird, that if ever you do kill my trust in
you, you will kill&mdash;everything else along with it."</p>

<p>"<i>Theo!</i>"</p>

<p>There was sharp pain in the cry, and she swung round,
flinging out her hands with a pathetic gesture of entreaty.
He did not take them as she half hoped he would; but stood
looking at her in a thoughtful silence. Then, "If you care
as much as that," he said slowly, "it lies with you not to
fling away the thing you care for. Will you please let me
see those bills."</p>

<p>"They are on the bureau. You can take them."</p>

<p>She turned again to the mantelpiece, for her lips were not
quite steady.</p>

<p>"You were going to tell me about them, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no. I wasn't."</p>

<p>He sighed; and taking up the papers, looked through them
absently, too deeply troubled to grasp their contents.</p>

<p>"Are these all?" he asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Nearly all."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea of the total?"</p>

<p>"About six hundred rupees."</p>

<p>A short silence followed, during which she again heard the
rustle of paper behind her, and longed for a sight of his
face.</p>

<p>"I am afraid this knocks the Lahore week on the head," he
said at length. "I am bound to run down for the Polo
Tournament, of course; but I can come straight back, and we
must do without the rest of it this year."</p>

<p>The incredible words roused Evelyn to open mutiny. Once more
she faced him, her head flung backward, a ring of resolve in
her voice.</p>

<p>"No, Theo, ... I <i>won't</i> do without the rest of it. <i>You</i>
don't care, I daresay! So long as you can win the Punjab
Cup, nothing else matters. But Christmas week is my only bit
of real pleasure in all the cold weather, and I <i>will</i> go
down for it, ... what<i>ever</i> you say."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>
<p>Theo Desmond was completely taken aback; and when surprise
gave place to speech, his tone suggested the iron hand under
the velvet glove.</p>

<p>"My dear little woman, you are talking nonsense. If I find
it impossible to manage Lahore, you will remain here. There
can be no question about that."</p>

<p>But Evelyn persisted with the courage of despair.</p>

<p>"Then you mustn't find it impossible, ... that's all! There
has been nothing but giving up ever since we came from
Murree. I'm sick of it; and I won't give up Christmas week,
too. It's quite hard enough for me as it is, being stranded
in the most hopeless part of India because of you, without
your grudging my few little pleasures as well." And sinking
into a chair, she hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p>The victory is more often to the unscrupulous than to the
strong. His wife's injustice cut Desmond to the quick.
Impulsive renunciation sprang to his lips; and was only
checked by the remembrance that he had given Honor his word.</p>

<p>"Evelyn&mdash;Evelyn," he pleaded with sudden vehemence, "for
Heaven's sake have a little consideration for facts&mdash;if you
have none for me. I grudge you nothing&mdash;I have never done
so&mdash;and you know it. But&mdash;if you really find Frontier life
intolerable, I can only give you free leave to go home,
directly I scrape together the money for your passage."</p>

<p>"Go home&mdash;&mdash;?" she echoed in blank bewilderment. "What do
you mean?"</p>

<p>"What I say."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;wouldn't you come too?"</p>

<p>"No. I have no leave due now; and if I had, I couldn't
afford to take it."</p>

<p>"You want me to go?" she flashed out in a tremor of
apprehension. "I'm only a hindrance to you here. That's the
real truth, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I never said that, and I have given you no grounds for
thinking it."</p>

<p>"But do you, Theo&mdash;<i>do</i> you?"</p>

<p>Her eyes searched his face for confirmation of her
suspicion, and found none.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>
<p>"What I want or don't want is beside the mark," he said. "I
naturally wish to see you happy; and as that evidently can't
be managed here, I am willing to let you go and be happy
elsewhere."</p>

<p>Her eyes fell and her answer came almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>"But I couldn't be happy anywhere else&mdash;without you."</p>

<p>"Is that the truth?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You'd prefer to stay here&mdash;with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He laid his hand for an instant on her bent head.</p>

<p>"Stay then, Ladybird, by all means. Only, for pity's sake,
spare me any more of the sort of things you said just now."</p>

<p>"And you won't stop me from going to Lahore,
Theo?&mdash;Promise."</p>

<p>A swift change of expression crossed his face.</p>

<p>"I can't promise that. I'll do my best not to disappoint
you, but I must get all these cleared off before I think of
anything else."</p>

<p>"How <i>can</i> you manage to clear them off&mdash;now?"</p>

<p>"Why trouble your head about side issues? They will all be
paid before Christmas; that ought to be enough for you."</p>

<p>"But it's not enough. Tell me what you are going to do&mdash;tell
me. I won't be pushed on one side like a child."</p>

<p>Desmond frowned.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if you insist on having it, I am going to sell
Diamond."</p>

<p>She started and caught at his arm. For all his
matter-of-fact coolness, she knew what those half-dozen
words meant to her husband.</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;no Theo. Not Diamond! He's the best of them all."</p>

<p>"Exactly. He'll sell quicker and fetch a longer price than
any of the others; that's why&mdash;he must go."</p>

<p>"But the tournament? Captain Olliver's mad about winning the
Cup this year."</p>

<p>"I know that. So am I. I shall manage about a third pony, no
fear. Time enough to think of that later. I must go and make
out those advertisements."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>
<p>He set his teeth upon the word and turned to leave her, but
her voice arrested him half-way to the door.</p>

<p>"Theo!"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Are you <i>sure</i> there's nothing else that can be done?
It&mdash;it isn't fair for you to lose the pony you love best,
just because of a few dressmakers' bills."</p>

<p>At that his pent-up bitterness slipped from leash.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>
<p>"Upon my soul, Evelyn, you're right. But there's no other
way out of the difficulty, so let's have no more words about
it: they don't make things easier to bear."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> many days later Desmond's advertisements appeared
simultaneously in the only two newspapers of Upper India;
and he set his face like a flint in anticipation of the
universal remonstrance in store for him, when the desperate
step he had taken became known to the regiment.</p>

<p>He was captain of the finest polo team on the frontier; the
one great tournament of the year&mdash;open to every Punjab
regiment, horse and foot&mdash;would begin in less than a
fortnight; and he, who had never parted with a polo pony in
his life, was advertising the pick of his stable for sale. A
proceeding so unprecedented, so perplexing to all who knew
him, could not, in the nature of things, be passed over in
silence. Desmond knew&mdash;none better&mdash;that victory or defeat
may hang on the turn of a hair; that, skilled player though
he was, the introduction of a borrowed pony, almost at the
last moment, into a team trained for months to play in
perfect accord was unwise, to say the least of it; knew also
that he would be called upon to justify his own unwisdom at
so critical a juncture, when all hearts were set on winning
the coveted Punjab Cup.</p>

<p>And justification was out of the question,&mdash;there lay the
sting.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>
<p>Loyalty to Evelyn sealed his lips; and even the loss of his
best-loved pony was less hard to bear than the possibility
of being misjudged by his brother officers, whose faith in
him had come to be an integral part of his life.</p>

<p>In his present cooler frame of mind he saw that his action
had been over-hasty; but with men of vehement temperament,
to think is to feel, to feel is to act,&mdash;reflection comes
last, if it ever comes at all. The first heat of vexation,
the discovery of his wife's untrustworthiness and the
sacrifice it entailed, had blinded him to all minor
considerations.</p>

<p>But these were details that could not be put into words. The
thing was done. To put a brave face on it, and to shield
Evelyn from the result of her own misdoing&mdash;there lay his
simple duty in a nutshell. The risk must be accepted, and
the Punjab Cup carried off in its despite. This man owed
more than he knew to the "beholden face of victory"; to his
life-long determination that, no matter what happened, he
must conquer.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile immediate issues demanded his full
attention.</p>

<p>Harry Denvil, as might be expected, sounded the first note
of protest.</p>

<p>He invaded the sacred precincts of his senior's study with
audacious lack of ceremony.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Desmond: but there was no one in the verandah,
and I couldn't wait. Of course you know what's in the wind.
The Colonel came on that advertisement of yours in 'The
Pioneer' just before tiffin, and you should have heard him
swear! He showed it to Major Wyndham, and asked: 'Was it a
practical joke?' But the Major seemed quite cut up; said he
knew nothing about it, and you would probably have good
reasons to give. The rest didn't take it so quietly; but of
course <i>I</i> understood at once. For God's sake, old chap,
cancel that confounded advertisement, and take back your
eight hundred. I can borrow it again from the <i>shroff</i>, just
for the present. Anything's better than letting you in for
the loss of Diamond at a time like this."</p>

<p>He broke off more from lack of breath than lack of matter;
and Desmond, who had risen to cope with the intruder, put
both hands upon the Boy's shoulders, a great kindliness
softening his eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>
<p>"My dear Harry, don't distress yourself," he said. "I
appreciate your generosity a good deal more than I care to
say. But you are not in any way to blame for the loss of
Diamond."</p>

<p>"But, Desmond&mdash;I don't understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are more things in heaven and earth...!" Desmond
quoted, smiling. "It's like your impertinence to understand
everything at four-and-twenty."</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up!" the other retorted, laughing in spite of
himself. "Can't you see I'm in earnest? You don't mean to
tell me&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"No, Harry, I don't mean to tell you anything about it. I'm
not responsible to you for my actions. Stay and have a pipe
with me to cool you down a bit. Not another word about my
affairs, or I take you by the shoulders and put you outside
the door."</p>

<p>Thus much for Denvil. But the rest could not be treated in
this summary fashion.</p>

<p>Wyndham put in an appearance at polo that afternoon. He
played fitfully; and at other times rode out to the ground,
which lay a mile or so beyond the station. To-day it
chanced&mdash;or possibly Paul so contrived it&mdash;that he and
Desmond rode home together, a little behind the others.</p>

<p>A low sun stretched out all the hills; distorted the shadows
of the riders; and flung a golden pollen of radiance over
the barren land.</p>

<p>The habit of silence was strong between these two men; and
for a while it lasted unbroken. Desmond was riding his
favourite pony, a spirited chestnut Arab, swift as a
swallow, sensitive as a child, bearing on his forehead the
white star to which he owed his name. The snaffle hung loose
upon his neck, and Desmond's hand rested upon the silken
shoulder as if in a mute caress. He knew what was coming,
and awaited Paul's pleasure with stoical resignation.</p>

<p>Wyndham considered the strong, straight lines of his
friend's profile thoughtfully; then he spoke:</p>

<p>"You gave us all rather a shock this morning, Theo."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for that. I was afraid there'd be some bother
about it. But needs must&mdash;when the devil drives."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>
<p>"The devil that drives you is your own incurable pride,"
Paul answered with unusual warmth. "You know, without
forcing me to put it in words, that every rupee I possess is
at your service. You might have given me a chance before
going such lengths as this."</p>

<p>Desmond shook his head. The man's fastidious soul revolted
from the idea of using Paul's money to pay his wife's bills.</p>

<p>"Not in these circumstances," he said. "It wasn't pride that
held me back; but a natural sense of the justice
and&mdash;fitness of things. You must take that on trust, Paul."</p>

<p>"Why, of course, my dear chap. But how about the fitness of
parting with that pony just before the tournament? As
captain of the team, do you think you are acting quite
fairly by the Regiment?"</p>

<p>The shot told. Among soldiers of the best sort the Regiment
is apt to be a fetish, and to Desmond the lightest
imputation of disregard for its welfare was intolerable.</p>

<p>"Is that how the other fellows look at it?" he asked, a
troubled note in his voice.</p>

<p>"Well, if they do, one can hardly blame them. They naturally
want to know what you mean to do about the tournament after
you have let your best pony go? I take it for granted that
you have some sort of plan in your head."</p>

<p>"Yes. I am counting on you to lend me Esmeralda. It's only
the 6th now; and if I train her for all I'm worth between
this and the 20th, I can get her up to the scratch."</p>

<p>Paul's answering smile was oddly compact of tenderness and
humour.</p>

<p>"So that's your notion? You'll deign to make use of me so
far? Upon my soul, Theo, you deserve that I should refuse,
since you won't give me the satisfaction of doing what would
be far more to the purpose."</p>

<p>Desmond looked his friend steadily in the eyes.</p>

<p>"You'll not refuse, though," he said quietly, and Paul shook
his head. By way of thanks, Theo laid his hand impulsively
upon Wyndham's arm.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>
<p>"I'm sure you understand, dear old man, that it's not easy
or pleasant for me to part with Diamond, or to shut you out
and refuse your help; but I can't endure that the rest of
them should think me slack or careless of their interests."</p>

<p>"They know you far too well to think anything of the sort.
By the way, what arrangements are you making for Lahore?"</p>

<p>"None at all. Honor will go, I daresay; and I shall run down
for the polo. But fifteen days' leave is out of the
question."</p>

<p>Paul turned sharply in his saddle.</p>

<p>"Now, look here, Theo&mdash;you're going too far. I make no offer
this time. I simply insist!"</p>

<p>Desmond hesitated. The thought of Evelyn was knocking at his
heart.</p>

<p>"You know I hate accepting that sort of thing," he objected,
"even from you."</p>

<p>Wyndham laughed.</p>

<p>"That's your peculiar form of selfishness, my dear chap. You
want to keep the monopoly of giving in your own hands. Very
wholesome for you to have the tables turned. Besides," urged
the diplomatist, boldly laying down his trump card, "it
would be a great disappointment to your wife not to go down
with us all and see the matches."</p>

<p>"Yes. That's just the difficulty."</p>

<p>"I'm delighted to hear it! The Lahore week shall be my
Christmas present to her and you; and there's an end of
<i>that</i> dilemma."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Paul," Desmond said simply. "I'll tell her
to-night. Come over to dinner," he added as they parted.
"The Ollivers will be there; and I may stand in need of
protection."</p>

<p>The sound of music greeted him from the hall, and he found
Honor playing alone in the dusk.</p>

<p>"Please go on," he said, as she rose to greet him. "It's
what I want more than anything at this moment."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>
<p>The girl flushed softly, and turned back to the instrument.
Any one who had heard her playing before Desmond came in,
could scarcely have failed to note the subtle change in its
quality. She made of her music a voice of sympathy, evolved
from the heart of the great German masters; whose satisfying
strength and simplicity&mdash;so far removed from the restless
questioning of our later day&mdash;were surely the outcome of a
large faith in God; of the certainty that effort,
aspiration, and endurance, despite their seeming futility,
can never fail to be very much worth while.</p>

<p>In this fashion Honor reassured her friend to his complete
comprehension; and while he sat listening and watching her
in the half light, he fell to wondering how it came about
that this girl, with her generous warmth of heart, her
twofold beauty of the spirit and the flesh, should still be
finding her central interest in the lives of others rather
than in her own. Was the inevitable awakening over and done
with? Or was it yet to come? He inclined to the latter view,
and the thought of Paul sprang to his mind. Here, surely,
was the one woman worthy of his friend. But then, Paul held
strong views about marriage, and it was almost impossible to
picture the good fellow in love.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the good fellow was, at that time, more
profoundly, more irrevocably in love than Desmond himself
had ever been, notwithstanding the fact of his marriage. His
theories had proved mere dust in the balance when weighed
against his strong, simple-hearted love for Honor Meredith.
Yet the passing of nine months found him no nearer to open
recantation. If a man has learnt nothing else by the time he
is thirty-eight, he has usually gained possession of his
soul, and at no stage of his life had Paul shown the least
talent for taking a situation by storm. In the attainment of
Honor's friendship, this most modest of men felt himself
blest beyond desert; and watch as he might for the least
indication of a deeper feeling, he had hitherto watched in
vain. It never occurred to him that his peculiarly reticent
form of wooing&mdash;if wooing it could be called&mdash;was hardly
calculated to enlighten her as to the state of his heart. He
merely reined in his great longing and awaited possible
developments; accepting, in all thankfulness, the certain
good that was his, and determined not to risk the loss of it
without some hope of greater gain.</p>

<p>But of all these things Desmond guessed nothing as he sat,
in the dusk of that December evening, speculating on the
fate of the girl whose friendship he frankly regarded as one
of the goodliest gifts of life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>
<p>When at last she rose from the piano, he rose also.</p>

<p>"<i>Thank</i> you," he said with quiet emphasis. "How well you
understand!"</p>

<p>"Don't let yourself be troubled by anything the Ollivers may
say or think," she answered softly. "You are doing your
simple duty, Theo, and I am sure Major Wyndham, even without
knowing all the facts, will understand quite as well&mdash;as I
do."</p>

<p>With that she left him, because the fulness of her
understanding put a check upon further speech.</p>

<p>That night, when the little party had broken up without open
warfare, and Desmond stood alone with his wife before the
drawing-room fire, he told her of Wyndham's generosity.</p>

<p>"You'll get your week at Lahore, Ladybird," he said. "And
you owe it to Paul. He wishes us to accept the trip as his
Christmas present."</p>

<p>"Oh, Theo...!" A quick flush revealed her delight at the
news, and she made a small movement towards him; but nothing
came of it. Six months ago she would have nestled close to
him, certain of the tender endearments which had grown
strangely infrequent of late. Now an indefinable shyness
checked the spontaneous caress, the eager words upon her
lips. But her husband, who was looking thoughtfully into the
fire, seemed serenely unaware of the fact.</p>

<p>"You're happy about it, aren't you?" he asked at length.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;of course&mdash;very happy."</p>

<p>"That's all right; and I'm glad I wasn't driven to
disappoint you. Now get to bed; and sleep soundly on your
rare bit of good luck. I have still a lot of work to get
through."</p>

<p>She accepted his kindly dismissal with an altogether new
docility; and on arriving in her own room gave conclusive
proof of her happiness by flinging herself on the bed in a
paroxysm of stifled sobbing.</p>

<p>"Oh, if only I had told him sooner!" she lamented through
her tears. "Now I don't believe he'll ever really forgive
me, or love me properly again."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>
<p>And, in a measure, she was right. Trust her he might, as in
duty bound; but to be as he had been before eating the
bitter fruit of knowledge was, for the present at all
events, out of his power.</p>

<p>Since their momentous talk nearly a week ago, Evelyn had
felt herself imperceptibly held at arms' length, and the
vagueness of the sensation increased her discomfort tenfold.
No word of reproach had passed his lips, nor any further
mention of Diamond or the bills; nothing so quickly breeds
constraint between two people as conscious avoidance of a
subject that is seldom absent from the minds of both. Yet
Theo was scrupulously kind, forbearing,
good-tempered&mdash;everything, in short, save the tender,
lover-like husband he had been to her during the first
eighteen months of marriage. And she had only herself to
blame,&mdash;there lay the sharpest pang of all. Life holds no
anodyne for the sorrows we bring upon ourselves.</p>

<p>As the days wore on she watched Theo's face anxiously, at
post time, for any sign of an answer to that hateful
advertisement; and before the week's end she knew that the
punishment that should have been hers had fallen on her
husband's shoulders.</p>

<p>Coming into breakfast one morning, she found him studying an
open letter with a deep furrow between his brows. At sight
of her he started and slipped it into his pocket.</p>

<p>The meal was a silent one. Evelyn found the pattern of her
plate curiously engrossing. Desmond, after a few hurried
mouthfuls, excused himself and went out. Then Evelyn looked
up; and the tears that hung on her lashes overflowed.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he's gone to the stables, Honor," she said brokenly.
"He got an answer this morning;&mdash;I'm sure he did. But he&mdash;he
won't tell me anything now. Where's the <i>use</i> of being
married to him if he's always going on like this? I wish&mdash;I
wish he could sell&mdash;<i>me</i> to that man, instead of Diamond. He
wouldn't mind it <i>half</i> as much&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And with this tragic announcement&mdash;which, for at least five
minutes, she implicitly believed&mdash;her head went down upon
her hands.</p>

<p>Honor soothed her very tenderly, realising that she sorrowed
with the despair of a child who sees the world's end in
every broken toy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>
<p>"Hush&mdash;hush!" she remonstrated. "You mustn't think anything
so foolish, so unjust. Theo is very magnanimous, Evelyn. He
will see you are sorry, and then it will all go smoothly
again."</p>

<p>"But there's the&mdash;the other thing," murmured the pretty
sinner with a doleful shake of her head. "He won't forgive
me that; and he <i>doesn't</i> seem to see that I'm sorry. I
wanted to tell him this morning, when I saw that letter. But
he somehow makes me afraid to say a word about it."</p>

<p>"Better not try yet awhile, dear. When a man is in trouble,
there is nothing he thanks one for so heartily as for
letting him alone till it is well over."</p>

<p>Evelyn looked up again with a misty smile.</p>

<p>"I can't think why you know so much about men, Honor. How do
you find out those sort of things?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it's because I've always cared very much for
men,"&mdash;she made the statement quite unblushingly. "Loving
people is the only sure way of understanding them in the
long-run."</p>

<p>"<i>Is</i> it?... You are clever, Honor. But it doesn't seem to
help me much with Theo."</p>

<p>Such prompt, personal application of her philosophy of the
heart was a little disconcerting. The girl could not well
reply that in love there are a thousand shades, and very few
are worthy of the name.</p>

<p>"It <i>will</i> help you in time," she said reassuringly. "It is
one of the few things that cannot fail. And to-day, at
least, you have learnt that when things are going hardly
with Theo, it is kindest and wisest to leave him alone."</p>

<p>Evelyn understood this last, and registered a valiant
resolve to that effect.</p>

<p>But the day's events gave her small chance of acting on her
new-found knowledge. Desmond himself took the initiative:
and save for a bare half-hour at tiffin, she saw him no more
until the evening.</p>

<p>Perhaps only the man who has trained and loved a polo pony
can estimate the pain and rebellion of spirit that he was
combating, doggedly and in silence; or condone the passing
bitterness he felt towards his uncomprehending wife.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>
<p>He spent more time than usual in the stables, where Diamond
nuzzled into his breast-pocket for slices of apple and
sugar; and Diamond's <i>sais</i> lifted up his voice and wept, on
receipt of an order to start for Pindi with his charge on
the following day.</p>

<p>"There is no Sahib like my Sahib in all Hind," he protested,
his turban within an inch of Desmond's riding-boot. "The
Sahib is my father and my mother! How should we serve a
stranger, Hazúr,&mdash;the pony and I?"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, it is an order," Desmond answered not
unkindly, "that thou shouldst remain with the pony, sending
word from time to time that all goeth well with him. Rise
up. It is enough."</p>

<p>Returning to the house, he hardened his heart, and accepted
the unwelcome offer from Pindi.</p>

<p>"What a confounded fool I am!" he muttered, as he stamped
and sealed the envelope. "I'd sooner shoot the little chap
than part with him in this way."</p>

<p>But the letter was posted, nevertheless.</p>

<p>He excused himself from polo, and rode over to Wyndham's
bungalow, where he found Paul established in the verandah
with his invariable companions&mdash;a pipe, and a volume of
poetry or philosophy.</p>

<p>"Come along, and beat me at rackets, old man," he said
without dismounting. "I'm 'off' polo to-day. We can go for a
canter afterwards."</p>

<p>Wyndham needed no further explanation. A glance at Theo's
face was enough. They spent four hours together; talked of
all things in heaven and earth, except the one sore subject;
and parted with a smile of amused understanding.</p>

<p>"Quite like old times!" Paul remarked, and Desmond nodded.
For it was a habit, dating from early days, that whenever
the pin-pricks of life chafed Theo's impatient spirit, he
would seek out his friend, spend an hour or two in his
company, and tell him precisely nothing.</p>

<p>Thanks to Paul's good offices, dinner was a pleasanter meal
than the earlier ones had been. But Evelyn looked white and
woe-begone; and Honor wisely carried her off to bed, leaving
Desmond to his pipe and his own discouraging thoughts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>
<p>These proved so engrossing that he failed to hear a step in
the verandah, and started when two hands came quietly down
upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>No need to ask whose they were. Desmond put up his own and
caught them in a strong grip.</p>

<p>"Old times again, is it?" he asked, with a short satisfied
laugh. "Brought your pipe along?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Good business. There's your chair,&mdash;it always seems yours
to me still. Have a 'peg'?"</p>

<p>Paul shook his head, and drew his chair up to the fire with
deliberate satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Light up, then; and we'll make a night of it as we used to
do in the days before we learned wisdom, and paid for it in
hard cash."</p>

<p>"Talking of hard cash&mdash;what price d'you get?" the other
asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"Seven-fifty."</p>

<p>"Will that cover everything?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Theo,&mdash;why, in Heaven's name, won't you cancel this
wretched business, and take the money from me instead?"</p>

<p>"Too late now. And, in any case, it's out of the question,
for reasons that you would be the first to appreciate&mdash;if
you knew them."</p>

<p>"But look here&mdash;suppose I do know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Desmond lifted a peremptory hand.</p>

<p>"Whatever you think you know, for God's sake don't put it
into words. I'm bound to go through with this, Paul, in the
only way that seems right to me. Don't make it harder than
it is already. Besides," he added, with a brisk change of
tone, "this is modern history! We're pledged to old times
to-night."</p>

<p>Evelyn's fantastic French clock struck three, in silver
tones, before the two men parted.</p>

<p>"It's an ill wind that blows no good, after all!" Desmond
remarked, as he stood in a wide splash of moonlight on the
verandah steps. "I feel ten years younger since the morning.
Come again soon, dear old man; it's always good to see you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>
<p>And Paul Wyndham, riding homeward under the myriad lamps of
heaven, thanked God, in his simple devout fashion, for the
courage and constancy of his friend's heart.</p>

<h4>GOOD ENOUGH, ISN'T IT?</h4>

<div class="blockpoem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"One crowded hour of glorious life."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Scott.</span></span><br />
<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dusty parade-ground of Mian Mir, Lahore's military
cantonment, vibrated from end to end with a rising tide of
excitement.</p>

<p>On all sides of the huge square eight thousand spectators,
of every rank and race and colour, were wedged into a
compact mass forty or fifty deep: while in the central
space, eight ponies scampered, scuffled, and skidded in the
wake of a bamboo-root polo-ball; theirs hoofs rattling like
hailstones on the hard ground.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>
<p>And close about them&mdash;as close as boundary flags and
distracted native policemen would permit&mdash;pressed that solid
wall of onlookers&mdash;soldiers, British and native, from thirty
regiments at least; officers, in uniform and out of it;
ponies and players of defeated teams, manfully resigned to
the "fortune o' war," and not forgetful of the obvious fluke
by which their late opponents had scored the game; official
dignitaries, laying aside dignity for the occasion; drags,
phaetons, landaus, and dog-carts, gay as a summer parterre
in a wind, with the restless parasols and bonnets of half
the women in the Punjab; scores and scores of <i>saïses</i>,
betting freely on the match, arguing, shouting, or
shampooing the legs of ponies, whose turn was yet to come;
and through all the confused hubbub of laughter, cheering,
and mercifully incoherent profanity, a British infantry band
hammering out with insular assurance, "We'll fight and we'll
conquer again and again."</p>

<p>It was the last day of the old year&mdash;a brilliant Punjab
December day&mdash;and the last "chukker" of the final match for
the Cup was in full progress. It lay between the Punjab
Cavalry from Kohat and a crack Hussar team, fresh from Home
and Hurlingham, mounted on priceless ponies, six to each
man, and upheld by an overweening confidence that they were
bound to "sweep the board." They had swept it accordingly;
and although anticipating "a tough tussle with those game
'Piffer'<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
 chaps," were disposed to look upon the Punjab
Cup as their own property for at least a year to come.</p>

<p>Desmond and his men&mdash;Olliver and two native officers&mdash;knew
all this well enough; knew also that money means pace, and
weight, and a liberal supply of fresh mounts, and frankly
recognised that the odds were heavily against them. But
there remained two points worth considering:&mdash;they had been
trained to play in perfect unison, horse and man; and they
were all in deadly earnest.</p>

<p>They had fought their way, inch by inch, through the
tournament to this final tie; and it had been a glorious
fight so far. The Hussars, whose self-assurance had led them
to underrate the strength of the enemy, were playing now
like men possessed. The score stood at two goals all, and
electric shocks of excitement tingled through the crowd.</p>

<p>Theo Desmond was playing "back," as a wise captain should,
to guard the goal and ensure the completest control over his
team; and his mount was a chestnut Arab with three white
stockings and a star upon his forehead.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>This unlooked-for circumstance requires explanation.</p>

<p>A week earlier, on returning from his morning ride to the
bungalow where Paul and his own party were staying, Desmond
had been confronted by Diamond in a brand-new saddle-cloth
marked with his initials; while Diamond's <i>sais</i>, with a
smile that displayed every tooth in his head, salaamed to
the ground.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm shot!" he exclaimed. "Dunni,&mdash;what's the meaning
of this?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>
<p>The man held out a note in Colonel Buchanan's handwriting.
Desmond dismounted, flung an arm over the Arab's neck, and
opened the note with a strange quickening of his breath.</p>

<p>The Colonel stated, in a few friendly words, that as Diamond
was too good a pony to be allowed to go out of the Regiment,
he and his brother officers had decided to buy him back for
the Polo Club. Major Wilkinson of the Loyal Monmouth had
been uncommonly decent over the whole thing; and, as captain
of the team, Desmond would naturally have the use of Diamond
during the tournament, and afterwards, except when he
happened to be away on leave.</p>

<p>It took him several minutes to grasp those half dozen lines
of writing; and if the letters grew indistinct as he read,
he had small cause to be ashamed of the fact.</p>

<p>On looking up, he found Paul watching him from the verandah;
and dismissing the <i>sais</i> he sprang up the steps at a bound.</p>

<p>"Paul,&mdash;was it your notion?"</p>

<p>But the other smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Brilliant inspirations are not in my line, old chap. It was
Mrs Olliver. She and the Colonel did most of it between
them, though we're all implicated, of course; and I don't
know when I've seen the Colonel so keen about anything in
his life."</p>

<p>"God bless you all!" Desmond muttered under his breath. "I'm
bound to win the Cup for you after this."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>And now, as the final "chukker" of the tournament drew to a
close, it did indeed seem that the ambition of many years
was on the eve of fulfilment. Excitement rose higher every
minute. Cheers rang out on the smallest provocation. General
sympathy was obviously with the Frontier team, and the
suspense of the little contingent from Kohat had risen to a
pitch beyond speech.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>
<p>All the native officers and men who could get leave for the
great occasion formed a picturesque group in the forefront
of the crowd; Rajinder Singh towering in their midst, his
face set like a mask; his eyes fierce with the lust of
victory. Evelyn Desmond, installed beside Honor in a
friend's dog-cart, sat with her small hands clenched, her
face flushed to the temples, disjointed murmurs breaking
from her at intervals. Honor sat very still and silent,
gripping the iron bar of the box-seat, her whole soul
centred on the game. Paul Wyndham, who had mounted the step
on her side of the cart, and whose hand clasped the bar
within half an inch of hers, had not spoken since the ponies
last went out; and to all appearance his concentration
equalled her own. But her nearness affected him as the
proximity of iron affects the needle of a compass,
deflecting his thoughts and eyes continually from the
central point of interest.</p>

<p>And what of Frank Olliver?</p>

<p>Her effervescent spirit can only be likened to champagne
just before the cork flies off. Perched upon the front seat
of a drag, with Colonel Buchanan, she noted every stroke and
counter-stroke, every point gained and lost, with the
practised knowledge of a man, and the one-sided ardour of a
woman. She had already cheered herself hoarse; but still
kept up a running fire of comment, emphasised by an
occasional pressure of the Colonel's coat-sleeve, to the
acute discomfiture of that self-contained Scot.</p>

<p>"We'll not be far off the winning post now," she assured him
at this juncture. "Our ponies are playing with their heads
entirely, and the others are losing theirs because of the
natives and the cheering. There goes the ball straight for
the boundary again!&mdash;Well done, Geoff! But the long fellow's
caught it&mdash;Saints alive! 'Twould have been a goal but for
Theo. How's <i>that</i> for a fine stroke, now?"</p>

<p>For Desmond, with a clean, splitting smack, had sent the
ball flying across three-fourths of the ground.</p>

<p>"Mind the goal!" he shouted to his half-back, Alla Dad Khan,
as Diamond headed after the ball like a lightning streak,
with three racers&mdash;maddened by whip and spur and their own
delirious excitement&mdash;clattering upon his tail; and a
fusilade of clapping, cheers, and yells broke out on all
sides.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>
<p>The ball, checked in mid career, came spinning back to them
with the force of a rifle-bullet. The speed had been
terrific, and the wrench of pulling up wrought dire
confusion. Followed a sharp scrimmage, a bewildering jumble
of horses and men, rattling of sticks and unlimited breaking
of the third commandment; till the ball shot out again into
the open, skimming, like a live thing, through a haze of
fine white dust, Desmond close upon it, as before; the
Hussar "forwards" in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>But their "back" was ready to receive the ball, and Desmond
along with it. Both players struck simultaneously. Their
cane-handled sticks met with a crack that was heard all over
the ground. Then the ball leapt clean through the
goal-posts, the head of Desmond's stick leapt after it, and
the crowd scattered right and left before a thundering
onrush of ponies. Cheer upon cheer, yell upon yell, went up
from eight thousand throats at once. British soldiers flung
their helmets in the air; the band lost its head and broke
into a triumphant clash of discord; while Colonel Buchanan,
forgetful of his Scottish decorum, stood up in the drag and
shouted like any subaltern.</p>

<p>He was down in the thick of the <i>melée</i>, ready to greet
Desmond as he rode off the battlefield, a breathless
unsightly victor, covered with dust and glory.</p>

<p>"Stunningly played&mdash;the whole lot of you!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. Good enough, isn't it?"</p>

<p>A vigorous handshake supplied the rest; and Desmond trotted
forward to the dog-cart, where Evelyn greeted him with a
rush of congratulation. Honor had no word, but Desmond found
her eyes and smile sufficiently eloquent.</p>

<p>"Best fight, bar none, I ever had in my life!" he declared
by way of acknowledgment. "We're all off to the B.C. Mess as
soon as the L.G. has presented the Cup, and we've got some
of the dust out of our throats. Come along, Paul, old man."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>
<p>And he went his way in such elation of spirits as a captain
may justly feel whose team has carried off the Punjab Cup in
the face of overwhelming odds.</p>

<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Fancy Ball, given on Old Year's night by the Punjab
Commission, was, in Evelyn's eyes, the supreme event of the
week; and when Desmond, after a mad gallop from the Bengal
Cavalry Mess, threw open his bedroom door, he was arrested
by a vision altogether unexpected, and altogether satisfying
to his fastidious taste.</p>

<p>A transformed Evelyn stood before the long glass, wrapt in
happy contemplation of her own image. From the fillet across
her forehead, with its tremulous wire antennæ, to the
sandalled slipper that showed beneath her silken draperies,
all was gold. Two shimmering wings of gauze sprang from her
shoulders; her hair, glittering with gold dust, waved to her
waist; and a single row of topaz gleamed on the pearl tint
of her throat like drops of wine.</p>

<p>"By Jove, Ladybird,&mdash;how lovely you look!"</p>

<p>She started, and turned upon him a face of radiance.</p>

<p>"I'm the Golden Butterfly. Do you like me, Theo, really?"</p>

<p>"I do;&mdash;no question. Where on earth did you get it all?"</p>

<p>"At Simla, last year. Muriel Walter invented it for me." Her
colour deepened, and she lowered her eyes. "I didn't show it
to you before,&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, yes,&mdash;I know what you mean. Don't distress yourself
over that. You'll have <i>your</i> triumph to-night, Ladybird!
Remember my dances, please, when you're besieged by the
other fellows! Upon my word, you look such a perfect
butterfly that I shall hardly dare lay a hand on you!"</p>

<p>"You may dare, though," she said softly. "I won't break in
pieces if you do."</p>

<p>Shy invitation lurked in her look and tone; but apparently
her husband failed to perceive it.</p>

<p>"I'll put you to the test later on," he said, with an amused
laugh. "I must go now, and translate myself into Charles
Surface, or I'll be late."</p>

<p>Left alone again, she turned back to her looking-glass and
sighed; but a single glance at it comforted her
surprisingly.</p>

<p>"He was in a hurry," she reflected, by way of further
consolation, "and I've got four dances with him after all."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Theo Desmond inscribed few names on his programme beyond
those of his wife, Mrs Olliver, and Honor Meredith.</p>

<p>"You must let me have a good few dances, Honor," he said to
her, "and hang Mrs Grundy! We are outsiders here, and you
and I understand one another."</p>

<p>She surrendered her programme with smiling submission. "Do
you always order people to give you dances in that
imperative fashion?"</p>

<p>"Only when I'm set on having them, and daren't risk refusal!
I'll go one better than Paul, if I may. I didn't know he had
it in him to be so grasping."</p>

<p>And he returned the card on which the initials P. W.
appeared four times in Wyndham's neat handwriting.</p>

<p>Never, in all his days had Paul asked a woman to give him
four dances; and as he claimed Honor for the first of them,
he wondered whether his new-found boldness would carry him
farther still. Her beauty and graciousness, her enthusiasm
over the afternoon's triumph, exalted him from the sober
levels of patience and modesty to unscaled heights of
aspiration. But not until their second valse together did an
opening for speech present itself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>
<p>They had deserted the packed moving mass, in whose midst
dancing was little more than a promenade under difficulties,
and stood aside in an alcove that opened off the ballroom.</p>

<p>"Look at Evelyn. Isn't she charming in that dress?" Honor
exclaimed, as the Golden Butterfly whirled past, like an
incarnate sunbeam, in her husband's arms. "I feel a
Methuselah when I see how freshly and rapturously she is
enjoying it all. This is my seventh Commission Ball, Major
Wyndham! No doubt most people think it high time I hid my
diminished head in England. But my head refuses to feel
diminished,"&mdash;she lifted it a little in speaking,&mdash;"and I
prefer to remain where I am."</p>

<p>"On the Border?"</p>

<p>"Yes. On the Border for choice."</p>

<p>"You were keen to get there, I remember," he said,
restraining his eagerness. "And you are not disappointed,
after nine months of it?"</p>

<p>"Disappointed?&mdash;I think they have been almost the best
months of my life."</p>

<p>She spoke with sudden fervour, looking straight before her
into the brilliant, shifting crowd.</p>

<p>Paul's pulses quickened. He saw possibilities ahead.</p>

<p>"Do you mean&mdash;&mdash;? Would you be content to live there&mdash;for
good?"</p>

<p>His tone caught her attention, and she turned to him with
disconcerting directness of gaze.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said quietly, "I would be quite content to live
on the Frontier&mdash;with John, if only he would have me. Now we
might surely go on dancing, Major Wyndham."</p>

<p>Paul put his arm about her in silence. His time had not yet
come; and he took up his burden of waiting again, if with
less hope, yet with undiminished resolve.</p>

<p>Honor, meanwhile, had leisure to wonder whether she had
imagined that new note in his voice. If not,&mdash;and if he were
to repeat the question in a more definite form&mdash;how should
she answer him?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>
<p>In truth she could not tell. Sincere admiration is not
always easy to distinguish from love of a certain order. But
Paul's bearing through the remainder of the dance convinced
her that she must have been mistaken, and she dismissed the
subject from her mind.</p>

<p>Leaving her in charge of Desmond, Wyndham slipped on his
greatcoat, and spent half an hour pacing to and fro, in the
frosty darkness, spangled with keen stars. Here, forgetful
of expectant partners, he took counsel with his cigar and
his own sadly sobered heart. More than once he asked himself
why those months on the Frontier had been among the best in
Honor Meredith's life. The fervour of her tone haunted him
with uncomfortable persistence; yet, had he put the question
to her, it is doubtful whether she could have given him a
definite answer, even if she would.</p>

<p>But although the lights and music and laughter had lost
their meaning for him, the great ball of the year went
forward merrily in regular alternations of sound and
silence, of motion and quiescence, to its appointed end.</p>

<p>It was during one of the intervals, when eye and ear enjoyed
a passing respite from the whirling wheel of things, that
Desmond, coming out of the cardroom&mdash;where he had been
enjoying a rubber and a cigarette&mdash;caught sight of a
gleaming figure standing alone in the pillared entrance to
the Hall, and hurried across the deserted ballroom. His wife
looked pathetically small and unprotected in the wide
emptiness of the archway, and the corners of her mouth
quivered as though tears were not far off.</p>

<p>"Oh, Theo,&mdash;I <i>am</i> glad!" she said as he reached her side.
"I wanted you&mdash;long ago, but I couldn't find you anywhere in
the crowd."</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, little woman?" he asked. "Quite
surprising to see you unappropriated. Any one been bothering
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a man. One of the stewards introduced him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The ready fire flashed in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Confound him! Where is he? What did he do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;very much. Only&mdash;I didn't like it. Come and sit
down somewhere and I'll tell you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>
<p>She slipped her hand under his arm, and pressed close to
him as they sought out a seat between the rows of
glass-fronted book-shelves in which the Lawrence Hall
library is housed.</p>

<p>"Here you are," he said. "Sit down and tell me exactly what
happened."</p>

<p>She glanced nervously at his face, which had in it a touch
of sternness that recalled their painful interview three
weeks ago.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't think he really knew what he was talking about,"
she began, her eyes on the butterfly fan, which she opened
and shut mechanically while speaking. "He began by saying
that fancy balls were quite different to other ones; that
the real fun of them was that every one could say and do
just what they pleased, and nothing mattered at all. He said
his own dress was specially convenient, because no one could
expect a Pierrot to be responsible for his actions. Then
he&mdash;he said that by coming as a butterfly I had given every
man in the room the right to&mdash;to catch me if he could.
Wasn't that hateful?"</p>

<p>"Curse him!" muttered Desmond under his breath. "Well&mdash;was
that all?"</p>

<p>She shook her head with a rueful smile.</p>

<p>"I don't half like telling you, Theo; you look so stern. I'm
afraid you'll be very angry."</p>

<p>"<i>Not</i> with you, dear. Go on."</p>

<p>"Well, I told him I didn't see it that way at all, and he
said of course not; butterflies never <i>did</i> see that people
had any right to catch them; yet they got caught all the
same. Then he took tight hold of my hands, and came so close
to me that&mdash;I was frightened, and asked him to take me back
to the ballroom at once. He said it wasn't fair, that the
whole twelve minutes belonged to him, and he wouldn't be
cheated out of any of it. Then when I was getting up to go
away, he&mdash;he laughed, and put his arm round me, so that I
couldn't move, though I tried to&mdash;I did, truly."</p>

<p>At that her husband's arm went round her, and she yielded
with a sigh of satisfaction to its protective pressure.</p>

<p>"The brute didn't dare to&mdash;kiss you, did he, Ladybird?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;no. The music began, and some people came by, and
he had to let me go. Do men often behave like that at balls,
Theo?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well&mdash;no; not the right sort!" Desmond answered, a gleam
of amusement in his eyes. "But there's always a good
sprinkling of the wrong sort in a crowd of this kind, and
the stewards ought to be more careful."</p>

<p>"The trouble is that&mdash;I gave him two dances. The next one is
his, and I <i>can't</i> dance with him again. That's why I so
badly wanted to find you. Listen, they're tuning up now.
Must I go and sit in the ladies' room till it's over?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. Come out and dance it with me."</p>

<p>"Can I? How lovely! I was afraid you were sure to be
engaged."</p>

<p>"Of course I am. But as you happen to need me, that doesn't
count."</p>

<p>She leaned forward suddenly, and gave him one of her quick,
half-shy kisses, that were still so much more like the
kisses of a child than of a woman grown. "It is nice to
belong to a man like you," she murmured caressingly. "You
really are a dear, Theo! And after I've been so bad to you,
too!"</p>

<p>"What's forgiven should be forgotten, Ladybird," he
answered, tightening the arm that held her. "So that's a
closed subject between us,&mdash;you understand? Only remember,
there must be <i>no more</i> of that sort of thing. Do you want
the compact signed and sealed?" he added, smiling.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I do." And he sealed it accordingly.</p>

<p>Two bright tears glistened on her lashes, for she had the
grace to realise that she was being blessed and trusted
beyond her deserts. A sudden impulse assailed her to tell
him everything&mdash;now, while his forgiveness enfolded her and
gave her a transitory courage. But habit, and dread of
losing the surpassing sweetness of reconciliation sealed her
lips; and her poor little impulse went to swell the sum of
unaccomplished things.</p>

<p>He frowned at sight of her mute signals of distress.</p>

<p>"No, no, little woman. That's forbidden also! Come along
out; and if that cad attempts to interfere with us, I'll
send him to the right about effectually, I promise you."</p>

<p>"But who <i>is</i> your real partner?" she asked, as they rose to
go.</p>

<p>"You are,&mdash;who else? My permanent partner!" he answered,
smiling down upon her. "I haven't a notion who the other is.
Let's stop under this lamp and see."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>
<p>He consulted his card, and his face clouded for a moment.</p>

<p>"It's Honor! That's rough luck. But at least one can tell
her the truth, and feel sure she'll understand. There she is
by that pillar, wondering what has come to me. Jove! How
splendid she looks to-night! I wish the Major could set eyes
on her."</p>

<p>The girl's tall figure, in its ivory and gold draperies,
showed strikingly against a mass of evergreens, and the
simple dignity of the dress she had herself designed
emphasised the queenly element in her beauty.</p>

<p>"Did you think I had deserted you altogether?" Desmond
asked, as they drew near.</p>

<p>"I knew you would come the first moment you could."</p>

<p>"You have a large faith in your friends, Honor."</p>

<p>"I have a very large faith&mdash;in you!" she answered simply.</p>

<p>"That's good hearing. But I hardly deserve it at this
minute. I have come to ask if I may throw you over for
Ladybird?" And in a few words he explained the reason of his
strange request.</p>

<p>One glance at Evelyn's face told Honor that the untoward
incident had dispelled the last shadow of restraint between
husband and wife; and the loss of a dance with Theo seemed a
small price to pay for so happy a consummation.</p>

<p>The valse was in full swing now,&mdash;a kaleidoscopic confusion
of colour, shifting into fresh harmonies with every bar;
four hundred people circling ceaselessly over a surface as
of polished steel.</p>

<p>Desmond guided his wife along the edge of the crowd till
they came again to the pillared entrance. Here, where it was
possible to stand back a little from the dancers, they were
confronted by a thick-set, heavy-faced man wearing the
singularly inept-looking costume of a Pierrot. Face and
carriage proclaimed that he had enjoyed his dinner very
thoroughly before setting out for the ball; and Evelyn's
small shudder fired the fighting blood in Desmond's veins.
It needed an effort of will not to greet his unsuspecting
opponent with a blow between the eyes. But instead, he stood
his ground and awaited developments.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>
<p>The man bestowed upon Evelyn a bow of exaggerated
politeness, which italicised his scant courtesy towards her
partner.</p>

<p>"There's some mistake here," he said bluntly. "This is <i>my</i>
dance with Mrs Desmond, and I've missed too much of it
already."</p>

<p>"Mrs Desmond happens to be my wife," Theo made answer with
ominous quietness. "I don't choose that she should be
insulted by her partners; and I am dancing this with her
myself."</p>

<p>The incisive tone, low as it was, penetrated the man's
muddled brain. His blustering assurance collapsed visibly,
increasing fourfold his ludicrous aspect. He staggered
backward, muttering incoherent words that might charitably
be construed as apology, and passed on into the library,
making an ineffectual effort to combine an air of dignified
indifference with the uncertain gait of a landsman in a
heavy sea.</p>

<p>Desmond stood looking after him as he went in mingled pity
and contempt; but Evelyn's eyes never left her husband's
face.</p>

<p>His smouldering anger, and the completeness of his power to
protect her by a few decisive words, thrilled her with a
new, inexplicable intensity,&mdash;an emotion that startled her a
little, and in the same breath lifted her to an unreasoning
height of happiness.</p>

<p>Unconsciously she pressed close against him as he put his
arm round her.</p>

<p>"You're all safe now, my Ladybird," he said with a low
laugh. "And honour is satisfied, I suppose! The creature
wasn't worth knocking down, though I could hardly keep my
fists off him at the start."</p>

<p>And he swept her forthwith into the heart of the
many-coloured crowd.</p>

<p>The valse was more than half over now, and as the music
slackened to its close some two hundred couples vanished
into the surrounding dimness, each intent on their own few
minutes of enjoyment. Evelyn Desmond, flushed, silent,
palpitating, remained standing at her husband's side, till
they were left practically alone under one of the many
arches that surround the great hall.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>
<p>"That was much too short, wasn't it?" he said. "Now we must
go and look up Honor, and see that she is not left in the
lurch."</p>

<p>At that she raised her eyes, and the soft shining in them
lent a quite unusual beauty to her face.</p>

<p>"Must we, Theo,&mdash;really? Honor's sure to be all right, and
I'm so badly wanting to sit out&mdash;with you."</p>

<p>"Are you, really? That's a charming confession to hear from
one's wife. You look different to-night, Ladybird. What's
come to you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she murmured truthfully; adding so low that
he could barely catch the words, "Only&mdash;I don't seem ever to
have understood&mdash;till just now how much&mdash;I really care&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why,&mdash;<i>Evelyn</i>!"</p>

<p>Sheer surprise checked further speech, and with a man's
instinctive sense of reserve he looked hastily round to make
sure that they were alone.</p>

<p>She misread his silence, and slipped a hand under his arm.</p>

<p>"You're not angry, are you&mdash;that I&mdash;didn't understand
sooner?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, no!"</p>

<p>"Then come&mdash;please come. Honor gave me the whole dance.
Besides&mdash;look!&mdash;there she goes with Major Wyndham. She's
always happy with him!"</p>

<p>Desmond smiled. "That's true enough. No need for us if Paul
is in the field. Come this way, Ladybird. I know the
Lawrence Hall of old."</p>

<p>They sought and found a sofa in a retired, shadowy corner.</p>

<p>"That's ever so nice," she said simply. "Sit down there."</p>

<p>He obeyed, and there was a momentary silence between them.
Then the emotion astir within her swept all before it.
Turning suddenly, she flung both arms round his neck and hid
her face upon his shoulder, her breath coming in short, dry
sobs, like the breath of an overwrought child.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>
<p>Very tenderly, as one who touches that which he fears to
bruise or break, he drew her close to him, his own pulses
quickened by a remembrance of the words that gave the clue
to her strange behaviour, and during those few minutes
between dance and dance, Evelyn Desmond arrived at a truer
knowledge of the man she had married, in the girlish
ignorance of mere fascination, than two years of life with
him had brought to her half-awakened heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the first six weeks of the new year life flowed serenely
enough in the bungalow on the mound.</p>

<p>Relieved of the greater part of her burden, and
re-established in her husband's heart, Evelyn Desmond
blossomed like a flower under the quickening influences of
spring. Light natures develop best in sunshine: and so long
as life asked no hard things of her, Evelyn could be
admirably sweet-tempered and self-forgetful&mdash;even to the
extent of curbing her weakness for superfluous hats and
gloves and shoes. A genuine sacrifice, this last, if not on
a very high plane. But the limits of such natures are set,
and their feats of virtue or vice must be judged
accordingly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>
<p>To Honor, whose very real sympathy was infallibly tinged
with humour, the bearing of this regenerate Evelyn suggested
a spoilt child who, having been scolded and forgiven, is
disposed to be heroically, ostentatiously good till next
time; and her goodness at least was whole-hearted while it
lasted. She made a genuine effort to handle the reins of the
household: waxed zealous over Theo's socks and shirts; and
sang to his accompaniment in the evenings. Her zest for the
tennis-courts waned. She joined Frank and Honor in their
frequent rides to the polo-ground, and Kresney found himself
unceremoniously discarded like a programme after a dance.</p>

<p>Wounded vanity did not improve his temper, and the
ever-present Linda suffered accordingly. For Kresney, though
little given to the weakness of generosity, never failed to
share his grievances liberally with those about him.</p>

<p>"What is this that has come to little Mrs Desmond?" he
demanded one evening on a querulous note of injury.
"Whenever I ask her to play tennis now she always manages to
be engaged. I suppose, because they have won that confounded
Punjab Cup, she thinks she must give herself airs like the
rest of them. But I tell you what, Linda, we have got to
make her understand that she is not going to get money out
of us, and then chuck us in the dirt like a pair of old
gloves,&mdash;you see? You must tell her you are in a hole now,
because of that three hundred rupees; that you have been
forced to get cash from me to go on with, and to let me know
about your little business with her; and you are afraid I
may refer the matter to her husband. It would bring his
cursed pride down with a run if he knew that his wife had
practically borrowed money from me, and he could say nothing
against <i>us</i> for helping her. It is she who would suffer;
and I am not keen to push her into a hot corner if she can
be made to behave decently enough to suit me. So just let
her know that I will make no trouble about it so long as she
is friendly, like she used to be. Then you can ask her to
tea; and I bet you five rupees she accepts on the spot!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Meantime Evelyn Desmond went on her way, in ignorance of the
forces that were converging to break up her newly-gotten
peace of mind. For the time being her world was filled and
bounded by her husband's personality. The renewal of his
tenderness and his trust in her eclipsed all the minor
troubles of life: and with the unthinking optimism of her
type she decided that these would all come right somehow,
some time, sooner or later.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>
<p>What Desmond himself thought did not transpire. Evelyn's
happiness gave him real satisfaction; and if he were already
beginning to be aware that his feeling for her left the
innermost depths of his nature unstirred, he never
acknowledged the fact. A certain refinement of loyalty
forbade him to discuss his wife, even with himself. Her
ineffectualness and the clinging quality of her love made an
irresistible appeal to the vein of chivalry which ran, like
a thread of gold, through the man's nature; and if he could
not forget, he could at least try not to remember, that her
standard of uprightness differed widely and radically from
his own.</p>

<p>When Kresney's tactics resulted in a partial revival of her
friendliness towards him, Desmond accepted the fact with the
best grace he could muster. Since his promise to the man
made definite objection impossible, he decided that the
matter must be left to the disintegration of time; and if
Kresney could have known how the necessity chafed Desmond's
pride and fastidiousness of spirit, the knowledge would have
added relish to his enjoyment of Evelyn's society.</p>

<p>Thus the passing of uneventful days brought them to the
middle of February&mdash;to the end of the short, sharp Northern
winter, and the first far-off whisper of the wrath to come;
brought also to Honor Meredith a sudden perception that her
year with the Desmonds was very nearly at an end. John's
latest letter announced that he hoped to get back to the
life and work he loved by the middle of April; and the girl
read that letter with such strangely mixed feelings that she
was at once puzzled and angered by her own seeming
inconsistency. John had always stood unquestionably first in
her life. It would be altogether good to have him with her
again&mdash;to be able to devote herself to him entirely as she
had dreamed of doing for so many years. And yet.... There
was no completing the broken sentence, which, for some
unaccountable reason, ended in a sigh.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>
<p>Honor was sitting at the time in her favourite corner of
the drawing-room, on a low settee constructed out of an
empty case, cunningly hid, and massed with cushions of dull
red and gold. As her lips parted in that unjustifiable sigh
she looked round at the familiar pictures and hangings; at
Desmond's well-worn chair, and the table beside it with his
pipe-rack, a photo of his father, and half a dozen favourite
books; at the graceful outline of Evelyn's figure where she
stood by the wide mantelshelf arranging roses in a silver
bowl, her head tilted to one side, a shaft of sunlight from
one of the slits of windows, fifteen feet up the wall,
turning her soft fair hair to gold.</p>

<p>From Evelyn's figure, Honor's glance travelled to the
photograph of Desmond on the piano, and lingered there with
a softened thoughtfulness of gaze. What deep roots she had
struck down into the lives of these two since her first
sight of that picture! A year ago the man had been a mere
name to her; and now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The clatter of hoofs, followed by Desmond's voice in the
verandah, snapped the thread of her thought, and roused
Evelyn from the contemplation of her roses.</p>

<p>"Theo <i>is</i> back early!" she exclaimed: and on the words he
entered the room, elation in every line of him, an unusual
light in his eyes.</p>

<p>"What <i>has</i> happened to make you look like that?" she asked.
"Somebody left you a fortune?"</p>

<p>Desmond laughed, with a peculiar ring of enjoyment.</p>

<p>"No fear! Fortunes don't grow hereabouts! But we've had
stirring news this morning. A big party of Afridis has
crossed the Border and fired a village, murdering and
looting cattle and women on a very daring scale. The whole
garrison is under orders for a punitive expedition. We shall
be off in ten days, if not sooner."</p>

<p>Evelyn's colour ebbed while he was speaking, and she made a
quick movement towards him. But Desmond taking her shoulders
between his hands, held her at arm's length, and confronted
her with steadfastly smiling eyes.</p>

<p>"No, no, Ladybird&mdash;you're going to be plucky and stand up to
this like a soldier's wife, for my sake. The Frontier's been
abnormally quiet these many months. It will do us all good
to have a taste of real work for a change."</p>

<p>"Do you mean ... will there be much ... fighting?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well&mdash;the Afridis don't take a blow sitting down. We have
to burn their crops, you see; blow up their towers; enforce
heavy fines, and generally knock it into their heads that
they can't defy the Indian Government with impunity. Yes; it
means fighting&mdash;severe or otherwise, according to their
pleasure."</p>

<p>"Pleasure!&mdash;It sounds simply horrible; and you&mdash;I believe
you're <i>glad</i> to go!"</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, what else would you have? Not because I'm
murderously inclined," he added smiling. "Every soldier
worth his salt is glad of a chance to do the work he's paid
for. But that's one of the things I shall never teach you to
understand!"</p>

<p>Evelyn turned hurriedly back to her roses. Her throat felt
uncomfortably dry, and two tears had escaped in spite of
herself.</p>

<p>"How long will you be gone?" she asked, addressing her
question to the flowers.</p>

<p>"A month or six weeks. Not longer."</p>

<p>"But won't any one be left to guard the station? In this
horrible place we women don't seem to count a bit. You all
rush off after a lot of stupid Afridis."</p>

<p>"Not quite all. An infantry regiment will come up from
Pindi: and we leave Paul's squadron behind. Just like his
luck to be out of it, poor old man. But six weeks will be
gone in no time. This sort of thing is part and parcel of
our life up here. You're not going to fret about it,
Ladybird&mdash;are you?"</p>

<p>He turned her face gently towards him. To his astonishment
eager entreaty shone through her tears, and she caught his
hand between her own.</p>

<p>"No, Theo, I needn't fret, because&mdash;if somebody has to
stay&mdash;it can just as easily be you. You're married and Major
Wyndham isn't."</p>

<p>Desmond stepped back a pace, incredulous anger in his eyes.
"Evelyn! Are you crazy? It's not the habit of British
officers to sneak behind their wives when they're wanted at
the front. It comes hard on you: but it's the price a woman
pays for marrying a soldier and there's no shirking it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>
<p>For answer she clung to his hand, pressing it close against
her heart. Instinctively she understood the power of her
weakness, and exercised it to the full. Perhaps, also, an
undefined fear of Kresney gave her courage to persist; and
the least mention of the man's name at that instant might
have averted many things.</p>

<p>"Only this time, please," she murmured, bringing the
beseeching softness of her eyes and lips very close to his
set face. "You'll be sorry afterwards if you leave me
alone&mdash;just now."</p>

<p>"Why just now? Besides, you won't be alone. You will have
Honor."</p>

<p>"Yes. But I want you. It has all been so lovely since
Christmas. Theo&mdash;darling,&mdash;I <i>can't</i> let you go, and&mdash;and
perhaps be killed by those horrid Afridis. Every one knows
how brave you are. They would never think you shirked the
fighting. And Major Wyndham would do anything you asked him.
Will you&mdash;<i>will</i> you?"</p>

<p>Desmond's mouth hardened to a dogged line, and he drew a
little away from her; because her entreaty and the
disturbing nearness of her face made resistance harder than
he dared allow her to guess.</p>

<p>"My dear little woman, you haven't the smallest notion what
you are asking of me. I never bargained for throwing up
active service on your account; and I'll not give the
fellows a chance to insult you by flinging marriage in my
teeth."</p>

<p>"That means&mdash;you insist on going?"</p>

<p>"My dear&mdash;I can do nothing else."</p>

<p>She threw his hand from her with a choking sob.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, go&mdash;go! I know, now, that you don't
really&mdash;care, in your heart&mdash;whatever you may say."</p>

<p>And turning again to the mantelpiece, she laid her head upon
her arms.</p>

<p>For a few moments Desmond stood regarding her, a great pain
and tenderness in his eyes.</p>

<p>"It is rather cruel of you to put it that way, Ladybird," he
said gently. "Can't you see that this isn't a question&mdash;of
caring, but simply of doing my duty? Won't you try and help
me, instead of making things harder for us both?"</p>

<p>He passed his hand caressingly over her hair, and a little
shiver of misery went through her at this touch.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>
<p>"It's all very well to talk grandly about duty," she
answered in a smothered voice. "And it's no use pretending
to love me&mdash;when you won't do anything I ask. But&mdash;you
<i>want</i> to go."</p>

<p>Desmond sighed, and instinctively glanced across at Honor
for a confirmation of his resolve not to let tenderness
undermine his sense of right. But that which he saw banished
all thought of his own heartache.</p>

<p>She sat leaning a little forward, her hands clasped tightly
over Meredith's letter, her face white and strained, her
eyes luminous as he had never yet seen them.</p>

<p>For the shock of his unexpected news had awakened her
roughly, abruptly to a very terrible truth. Since his
entrance into the room she had seen her phantom palace of
friendship fall about her like a house of cards; had seen,
rising from its ruins, that which her brain and will refused
to recognise, but which every pulse in her body confirmed
beyond possibility of doubt.</p>

<p>Desmond's eyes looking anxiously into hers, roused her to a
realisation of her urgent need to be alone with her
incredible discovery. Her lips lost their firmness; the hot
colour surged into her cheeks; and smoothing out John's
letter with uncertain fingers, she rose to her feet.</p>

<p>But in rising she swayed unsteadily; and in an instant
Desmond was beside her. He had never before seen this girl's
composure shaken, and it startled him.</p>

<p>"Honor, what has upset you so?" he asked in a low tone. "Not
bad news of John?" For he had recognised the writing.</p>

<p>She shook her head, fearing the sound of her own voice, and
his unfailing keenness of perception.</p>

<p>"You must be ill, then. I was afraid you were going to faint
just now. Come into the dining-room and have a glass of
wine."</p>

<p>She acquiesced in silence. It would be simplest to let him
attribute her passing weakness to physical causes. And she
went forward blindly, resolutely, with a proud lift of her
chin, never looking at him once.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>
<p>He walked beside her, bewildered and distressed, refraining
from speech till she should be more nearly mistress of
herself, and lightly holding her arm, because she was so
evidently in need of support. She tightened her lips and
mastered an imperious impulse to free herself from his
touch. His unspoken solicitude unnerved her; and a sigh of
pure relief escaped her when he set her down upon a chair,
and went over to the sideboard for some wine.</p>

<p>She sipped it slowly, supporting her head, and at the same
time shielding her eyes from his troubled scrutiny. He sat
beside her, on the table's edge, and waited till the
wineglass was half empty before he spoke.</p>

<p>"Did you feel at all ill this morning? I'll go for Mackay at
once to make sure there's nothing wrong."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no." There was a touch of impatience in her tone.
"Please don't bother. It is nothing. It will pass."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to vex you," he answered humbly. "But you are
not the sort of woman who goes white to the lips for
nothing. Either you are ill, or you are badly upset. You
promised John to let me take his place while he was away,
and if you are in any trouble or difficulty,&mdash;don't shut me
out. You have done immensely much for both of us. Give me
the chance to do a little for you. Remember, Honor," his
voice took a deeper note of feeling, "you are more to me
than the Major's sister or Ladybird's friend. You are mine,
too. Won't you tell me what's wrong?"</p>

<p>At that she pulled herself together and faced him with a
brave semblance of a smile.</p>

<p>"I am very proud to be your friend, Theo. But there are
times when the truest friendship is just to stand on one
side and ask no questions. That is what I want you to do
now. Please believe that if you could help me, even a
little, I would not shut you out."</p>

<p>"I believe you&mdash;and I'll not say another word. You will go
and lie down, perhaps, till tiffin time?"</p>

<p>"No. I think I will go to Ladybird. She badly needs
comforting. You broke your news to us rather abruptly, you
know. We are not hardened yet, like Frank, to the
boot-and-saddle life here."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. It was thoughtless of me. We are all so used to
it. One's apt to forget&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>
<p>He rose and took a few steps away from her; then,
returning, stood squarely before her. She had risen also,
partly to prove her own strength, and partly to put an end
to the strain of being alone with him.</p>

<p>"Honor," he asked, "was I hard with Ladybird? And am I an
unpardonable brute if I insist on holding out against her?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, no! You mustn't dream of doing anything else."</p>

<p>She looked full at him now, forgetful of herself in concern
for him.</p>

<p>"I was half afraid&mdash;once, that you were going to give way."</p>

<p>"Poor Ladybird! She little guessed how near I came to it.
And maybe that's as well, after all."</p>

<p>"Yes, Theo. It would be fatal to begin that way. I quite see
how hard it is for her. But she must learn to understand.
When it comes to active service, we women must be put
altogether on one side. If we can't help, we are at least
bound not to hinder."</p>

<p>Desmond watched her while she spoke with undisguised
admiration.</p>

<p>"Would you say that with the same assurance, I wonder, if it
were John? Or if it happened to be&mdash;your own husband?"</p>

<p>A rush of colour flooded her face, but she had strength
enough not to turn it aside.</p>

<p>"Of course I would."</p>

<p>"Then I sincerely hope you will marry one of us, Honor.
Wives of that quality are too rare to be wasted on
civilians!"</p>

<p>This time she bent her head.</p>

<p>"I should never dream of marrying any one&mdash;but a soldier,"
she answered very low. "Now I must go back to my poor Evelyn
and help her to see things more from your point of view."</p>

<p>"How endlessly good to us you are," he said with sudden
fervour. "I know I can count on you to keep her up to the
mark, and not let her make herself too miserable while we
are away."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes. I am only so thankful to be here with her&mdash;this
first time."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>
<p>He stood aside to let her pass; and she went out quickly,
holding her head higher than usual.</p>

<p>He followed at a little distance, still perplexed and
thoughtful, but refraining from the least attempt to account
for her very unusual behaviour. What she did not choose to
tell him he would not seek to know.</p>

<p>On the threshold of the drawing-room he paused.</p>

<p>His wife still stood where he had left her, disconsolately
fingering her roses, her delicate face marred with weeping.
Honor went to her straightway; and putting both arms round
her kissed her with a passionate tenderness, intensified by
a no less passionate self-reproach.</p>

<p>At the unnerving touch of sympathy Evelyn's grief broke out
afresh.</p>

<p>"Oh, Honor&mdash;Honor, comfort me!" she sobbed, unaware of her
husband's presence in the doorway. "You're the only one who
really cares. And he is so&mdash;so pleased about it. That makes
it worse than all!"</p>

<p>A spasm of pain crossed Desmond's face, and he turned
sharply away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>
<p>"Poor little soul!" he reflected as he went; "shall I ever
be able to make her understand?"</p>

<h4>LOVE THAT IS LIFE!</h4>

<div class="blockpoem">
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">"Love that is Life;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12.3em;">Love that is Death,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">Love that is mine!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18.5em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gipsy Song.</span></span><br />
<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> until night condemned her to solitude and thought did
Honor frankly confront the calamity that had come upon her
with the force of a blow, cutting her life in two,
shattering her pride, her joy, her inherent hopefulness of
heart.</p>

<p>The insignificant fact that her life was broken did not set
the world a hair's breadth out of gear; and through the day
she held her head high, looking and speaking as usual,
because she still had faith and strength and courage; and,
having these, the saddest soul alive will not be utterly
cast down.</p>

<p>She spent most of her time with Evelyn; and succeeded in so
far reconciling her to Theo's decision that Evelyn slipped
quietly into the study, where he sat reading, and flinging
her arms round him whispered broken words of penitence into
the lapel of his coat; a proceeding even more disintegrating
to his resolution than her attitude of the morning.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>
<p>Honor rode out to the polo-ground with them later on in the
day, returning with Paul Wyndham, who stayed to dinner, a
habit that had grown upon him since the week at Lahore. She
wondered a little afterwards what he had talked of during
the ride, and what she had said in reply; but since he
seemed satisfied, she could only hope that she had not
betrayed herself by any incongruity of speech or manner.</p>

<p>During the evening she talked and played with a vigour and
cheerfulness which quite failed to deceive Desmond. But of
this she was unaware. The shock of the morning had stunned
her brain. She herself and those about her were as
dream-folk moving in a dream while her soul sat apart, in
some vague region of space, noting and applauding her body's
irreproachable behaviour. Only now and then, when she caught
Theo's eyes resting on her face, the whole dream-fabric fell
to pieces, and stabbed her spirit broad awake.</p>

<p>Desmond himself could not altogether shut out anxious
conjecture. By an instinct he could hardly have explained,
he spoke very little to the girl, except to demand certain
favourite pieces of music, most of which, to his surprise,
she laughingly refused to play. Only, in bidding her
good-night, he held her hand a moment longer than usual,
smiling straight into her eyes; and the strong enfolding
pressure, far from unsteadying her, seemed rather to revive
her flagging fortitude. For who shall estimate the virtue
that goes out from the hand-clasp of a brave man, to whose
courage is added the strength of a stainless mind?</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>At last it was over.</p>

<p>She had left the husband and wife together, happy in a
reconciliation of her own making; had dismissed Parbutti,
bolted the door behind her, and now stood like one dazed,
alone with God and her grief, which already seemed old as
the stars,&mdash;a thing preordained before the beginning of
time.</p>

<p>She never thought of turning up the lamp; but remained
standing very straight and still, her hands clenched, all
the pride of her maidenhood up in arms against that which
dominated her, by no will of her own.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>
<p>She knew now, past question,&mdash;and the certainty crimsoned
her face and neck,&mdash;that she had loved him unwittingly from
the moment of meeting; possibly even from that earlier
moment when she had unerringly picked out his face from
among many others. Herein lay the key to her instinctive
recoil from too rapid intimacy; the key to the peculiar
quality of her intercourse with him, which had been from the
first a thing apart; as far removed from her friendship with
Wyndham as is the serenity of the foothills from the
life-giving breath of the heights.</p>

<p>And now&mdash;now that she had been startled into knowledge, the
whole truth must be confronted, the better to be
combated;&mdash;the truth that she loved him&mdash;with everything in
her&mdash;with every thought, every instinct of soul and body.
Nay, more, in the very teeth of her shame and
self-abasement, she knew that she was glad and proud to have
loved him, and no lesser man, even though the fair promise
of her womanhood were doomed to go down unfulfilled into the
grave.</p>

<p>Not for a moment did she entertain the cheap consolatory
thought that she would get over it; or would, in time, give
some good man the husk of her heart in exchange for the
first-fruits of his own. She held the obsolete opinion that
marriage unconsecrated by love was a deadlier sin than the
one into which she had fallen unawares; and which, at least,
need not tarnish or sadden any life save her own. This last
brought her sharply into collision with practical issues. In
the face of her discovery, dared she&mdash;ought she to remain
even a week longer under Theo's roof?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>
<p>Her heart cried out that she must go; that every hour of
intercourse with him was fraught with peril. The fact that
his lips were sealed availed her nothing; for these two had
long since passed that danger point in platonic friendship
when words are discarded for more direct communing of soul
with soul. Theo could read every look in her eyes, every
tone of her voice, like an open book, and she knew it;
though she had never acknowledged it till now. All
unconsciously he would wrest her secret from her by force of
sympathetic insight; and she, who implicitly believed in
God, who held suicide to be the most dastardly sin a human
being can commit, knew that she would take her own life
without hesitation rather than stand proven disloyal to
Evelyn, disgraced in the eyes of the man she loved. She did
not think this thing in detail. She merely knew it, with the
instinctive certainty of a vehement temperament that feels
and knows apart from all need of words.</p>

<p>Her character had been moulded by men&mdash;simple, upright men;
and she had imbibed their hard-and-fast notions of honour,
of right and wrong. She had power to turn her back upon her
love, to live out her life as though it were not, on two
conditions only. No one must ever suspect the truth. No one
but herself must suffer because of it. Conditions hard to be
fulfilled.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Theo</i>!"</p>

<p>The cry broke from her unawares&mdash;a throb of the heart made
vocal. It roused her to reality, to the fact that she had
been standing rigidly in the middle of the room,&mdash;how long
she knew not,&mdash;seeing nothing, hearing nothing, but the
voice of her tormented soul.</p>

<p>She went forward mechanically to the dressing-table, and
leaning her hands upon it, looked long and searchingly into
her own face. Her pallor, the ivory sheen of her dress, and
the unnatural lustre of her eyes, gave her reflection a
ghostly aspect in the dim light; and she shuddered. Was this
to be the end of her high hopes and ideals,&mdash;of her resolute
waiting and longing and praying for the very best that life
and love could give? Was it actually she,&mdash;John's
sister&mdash;her father's daughter&mdash;who had succumbed to this
undreamed-of wrong?</p>

<p>At thought of them, and of their great pride in her, all her
strained composure went to pieces. She sank into a chair and
pressed both hands against her face. But no tears forced
their way between her fingers. A girl reared by four
brothers is not apt to fall a-weeping upon every
provocation; and Honor suffered the more keenly in
consequence.</p>

<p>Suddenly the darkness was irradiated by a vision of Theo, as
he had appeared on entering the drawing-room that morning,
in the familiar undress uniform that seemed a part of
himself; bringing with him, as always, his own magnetic
atmosphere of alertness and vigour, of unquestioning
certainty that life was very much worth living. Every detail
of his face sprang clearly into view, and for a moment Honor
let herself go.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>
<p>She deliberately held the vision, concentrating all her
soul upon it, as on a face that one sees for the last time,
and wills never to forget. It was an actual parting, and she
felt it as such&mdash;a parting with the man who could never be
her friend again.</p>

<p>Then, chafing against her momentary weakness, she pulled
herself together, let her hands fall into her lap with a
slow sigh that was almost a sob, and wondered, dully,
whether sleep would come to her before morning. Certainly
not until she had considered her position
dispassionately,&mdash;neither ignoring its terrible
possibilities, nor exaggerating her own sense of shame and
disgrace,&mdash;and had settled, once for all, what honour and
duty demanded of her in the circumstances.</p>

<p>One fact at least was clear. Her love for Theo Desmond was,
in itself, no sin. It was a force outside the region of
will,&mdash;imperious, irresistible. But it set her on the brink
of a precipice, where only God and the high compulsion of
her soul could withhold her from a plunge into the abyss.</p>

<p>"Mine own soul forbiddeth me: there, for each of us, is the
eternal right and wrong." For Honor there could be no
thought, no question of the false step, or of the abyss; and
sinking on her knees she poured out her heart in a
passionate prayer for forgiveness, for light and wisdom to
choose the right path, and power to walk in it without
faltering to the end.</p>

<p>When at last she rose, her lips and eyes had regained
something of their wonted serenity. She knew now that her
impulse to leave the house at once had been selfish and
cowardly; that Evelyn must not be deserted in a moment of
bitter need; that these ten days must be endured for her
sake&mdash;and for his. On his return, she could find a
reasonable excuse for spending a month elsewhere till John
should come to claim her. Never in all her life had she been
called upon to make so supreme an effort of self-mastery;
and never had she felt so certain of the ultimate result.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>
<p>She turned up the lamp now, and looked her new life bravely
in the face, strong in her reliance on a Strength beyond her
own,&mdash;a Strength on which she could make unlimited demands;
which had never failed her yet, nor ever would to the end of
time.</p>

<h4>IT'S NOT MAJOR WYNDHAM.</h4>

<div class="blockpoem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"I will endure; I will not strive to peep</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">Behind the barrier of the days to come."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Owen Meredith.</span></span><br />
<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a few hours Honor slept soundly. But so soon as her
bodily exhaustion was repaired, grief and stress of mind
dragged her back to consciousness. She woke long before
dawn; woke reluctantly, for the first time in her life, with
a dead weight upon heart and brain; a longing to turn her
face to the wall and shut out the unconcerned serenity of
the new day.</p>

<p>But though hearts be at breaking-point, there is no shutting
out the impertinent details of life. And on this particular
morning Honor found herself plunged neck-deep in prose.
Domestic trifles thrust themselves aggressively to the fore.
Parbutti assailed her after breakfast with a voluble
diatribe against the dhobi's wife, whose eldest son was
going to and fro in the compound unashamed, wearing a shirt
made from the Memsahib's newest jharrons. She did not feel
called upon to add that her own under-jacket had begun life
upon Evelyn Desmond's godown shelves. It was not a question
of morals. It was the lack of a decent reserve in
appropriating her due share of the Sahib's possessions which
incensed the good lady against the dhobi's wife. Such
unreserve in respect of matters which should be hid might
rouse suspicion in other quarters; therefore it behoved
Parbutti to be zealous in casting the first stone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>
<p>Honor listened with weary inattention, promised
investigation of the matter, and passed on to the godown&mdash;a
closet of broad shelves stocked with an incongruous
assortment of household goods, and smelling strongly of
kerosine oil and bar soap.</p>

<p>Here it was discovered that the oil had been disappearing
with miraculous celerity, and Amar Singh cast aspersions on
the <i>kitmutgar</i> and his wife. A jealous feud subsisted
between him and them; and as ruler-in-chief of the Sahib's
establishment, the bearer made it a point of honour to let
no one cheat Desmond save himself. He had a grievous
complaint to lodge against a <i>sais</i>, who had been flagrantly
tampering with the Desmonds' grain, adding a request that
the Miss Sahib would of her merciful condescension impart
the matter to the Sahib. "For he sitteth much occupied, and
his countenance is not favourable this morning."</p>

<p>Honor complied, with a half-smile at the irony of her own
position, which, until to-day, she had accepted without
after-thought, and which of a sudden seemed unendurable.</p>

<p>Desmond, much engrossed in regimental concerns, and anxious
to get off to the Lines, was inclined to irritability and
abruptness; and the delinquent, who, with his charger ready
saddled, awaited the Sahib's displeasure in the front
verandah suffered accordingly. He bowed, trembling, to the
ground, and let the storm sweep over his head; making no
defence beyond a disarming reiteration of his own
worthlessness, and of his everlasting devotion to the
Protector of the Poor.</p>

<p>Turning back to the hall for his helmet, Desmond encountered
Honor in the doorway, and his wrath gave place to a smile of
good fellowship that brought the blood into her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Hope my volcanics didn't horrify you," he said
apologetically. "It seems almost as cowardly to fly out at
those poor chaps as to strike a child; but they have a
genius for tripping one up at critical moments."</p>

<p>He paused, and scanned her face with kindly anxiety. "You're
all right again now? Not troubled any more&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>
<p>"No. I'm perfectly well. Don't bother your head about me,
please. You have so much more important things to think
about."</p>

<p>Her colour deepened; and she turned so hastily away that, in
spite of his impatience to be gone, Desmond stood looking
after her with a troubled crease between his brows. Then he
swung round on his heel, vaulted into the saddle, and
straightway forgot everything except the engrossing prospect
of the campaign.</p>

<p>But for all his preoccupation, he had not failed to note the
wistfulness in Evelyn's dutifully smiling eyes. He was more
than usually tender with her on his return, and successfully
banished the wistfulness by giving up his polo to take her
for a ride. Honor stood watching them go, through tears
which rose unbidden from the depth of her lonely grief, her
haunting sense of disloyalty to the two she loved. She
dashed them impatiently aside the instant they moistened her
lashes; and betook herself for an hour's rest and
refreshment to Mrs Jim Conolly,&mdash;"Mrs Jim" was her station
name,&mdash;whose open-hearted love and admiration would give her
a much-needed sense of support.</p>

<p>She entered her friend's drawing-room without formal
announcement, to find her seated on a low sofa, barricaded
with piles of cotton frocks and pinafores, which had
suffered maltreatment at the hands of that arch-destroyer of
clothes and temper&mdash;the Indian dhobi.</p>

<p>"Don't get up, please," the girl said quickly, as Mrs
Conolly gathered her work together with an exclamation of
pleasure. "I've just come for a spell of peace and
quietness, to sit at the feet of Gamaliel and learn wisdom!"</p>

<p>She settled herself on the carpet,&mdash;a favourite attitude
when they were alone together,&mdash;and with a sigh of
satisfaction leaned against her friend's knee. The older
woman put an arm round her shoulders, and pressed her close.
Her mother's heart went out in very real devotion to this
beautiful girl, who, strong and self-reliant as she was,
turned to her so spontaneously for sympathy, counsel, and
love.</p>

<p>"Arrogant child!" she rebuked her, smiling. "Remember who it
was that sat at the feet of Gamaliel! But what particular
kind of wisdom are you wanting from me to-day?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>
<p>"No particular kind. I'm only liking to have you near me.
One is so sure of your faith in the ultimate best, that
there is encouragement in the touch of your hand."</p>

<p>She took it between both her own, and rested her cheek
against the other's arm, hiding her face from view.</p>

<p>Mrs Jim smiled, not ill pleased. She was one of those rare
optimists who, having frankly confronted the evil and
sorrow, the ironies and inconsistencies of life, can still
affirm and believe that "God's in his Heaven; all's right
with the world." But an unusual note in the girl's voice
perplexed her.</p>

<p>"Are you in special need of encouragement just now, dear?"
she asked. "Is that big baby of yours making you anxious on
account of this expedition?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;oh no! She is going to behave beautifully. The shock
upset her at first, and she wanted Theo to stay behind. It
was hard for him; but he held out; and I think I have helped
her to see that he was right. He has taken her for a ride
this afternoon and she is very happy."</p>

<p>"She has a great deal to thank you for, Honor," the elder
woman said gravely. "I felt from the first that you were in
rather a difficult position between those two, and you have
filled it admirably. I have said very little to you about
it, so far; but I have watched you and thought of you
unceasingly; and I believe Major Meredith would be prouder
of you than ever if he could realise that you have turned
your time of waiting to such good account."</p>

<p>Honor's cheek still rested against Mrs Conolly's arm, and
the warmth that fired it penetrated the thin muslin of her
blouse. She wondered a little, but said nothing; and after a
short pause Honor spoke in a low voice and with an attempt
at lightness which was not a conspicuous success.</p>

<p>"You think too well of me, so does John. I have done little
enough. Only, I care very much for&mdash;them both, and I want
them to be happy&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>
<p>"There are always two ways of stating a fact," the other
answered, smiling. "And&mdash;do you know, Honor, <i>I</i> care very
much for you&mdash;if you were my own child, I could hardly care
more&mdash;and, frankly, I want to see <i>you</i> happy in the same
way." She laid her free hand over the two that held her own.
"It would be a sin for a woman like you not to marry. I take
it for granted you have had chances enough, and I have
sometimes wondered&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl lifted her head and sat upright. She had come here
to escape her trouble, and it confronted her at every turn.</p>

<p>"Please&mdash;please don't begin wondering about that," she said
decisively, "or I shall have to get up and go away; and I
don't want to do that."</p>

<p>"No, no! my child, of course not. We will talk of other
things."</p>

<p>But the shrewd woman said within herself: "There <i>is</i> some
one after all," adding a heartfelt hope that it might be
Major Wyndham. Thus her next remark was more relevant to the
forbidden subject than Honor was likely to guess.</p>

<p>"I hear Major Wyndham's squadron remains behind. You are
glad, I suppose? You seem to be good friends."</p>

<p>"Yes; it will be a great comfort to have him when one will
be missing&mdash;all the rest. There are very few men in the
world like Major Wyndham; don't you think so? He has the
rare secret of being in it, yet not of it. I sometimes
wonder whether anything could really upset that
self-contained tranquillity of his, which makes him such a
restful companion."</p>

<p>Here was high praise, and Mrs Jim echoed it heartily; yet in
spite of it, perhaps because of it, she was far from
content. "It is not Major Wyndham," she decided,
regretfully. "But then,&mdash;who else is it likely to be?"</p>

<p>At this moment children's voices sounded in the garden and
Honor sprang impulsively to her feet. "Oh, there are Jimmy
and Violet!" she cried. "Let me go and be foolish with them
for a little and give them their tea. We can play at wisdom
again afterwards&mdash;you and I."</p>

<p>With that she hurried out into the garden; and in
surrendering herself to the superbly unconscious egotism of
childhood, found passing respite from the torment of her own
thoughts. But it was some time before Mrs Conolly returned
to her interrupted work.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>
<p>Paul Wyndham dined again at the blue bungalow that night;
and it soon became evident to Honor that something had
succeeded in upsetting the schooled serenity which was the
keynote of the man's character. Desmond kept the
conversation going with unflagging spirit, obviously for his
friend's benefit; but he never once mentioned the campaign;
and Honor began to understand that Paul rebelled, with quite
unusual vehemence, against an order which sent his friend on
active service without him. Then it occurred to her that he
must have been unlike himself the night before, and that
she, in her blind self-absorption, had noticed nothing.
Remorse pricked her heart and gave additional warmth to her
manner,&mdash;a fact which he was quick to perceive, and to
misinterpret.</p>

<p>The men sat a long while over their cigars, and thereafter
went into the study at Paul's request.</p>

<p>Honor had been right in her guess. The fiat of separation,
coming at a time of active service, had roused him as he was
rarely roused; had proved to him, if proof were needed, that
in spite of the strong love, which had opened new vistas of
thought and emotion for him during the past year, his
feeling for Desmond was, and always would be, the
master-force of his life. That he should be condemned to
play the woman's part and sit with idle hands while his
friend risked life and limb in the wild mountain country
across the Border, seemed for the moment more than he could
accept in silence.</p>

<p>He was obliged to own grudgingly that the Colonel was
justified in his decision,&mdash;that as Second in Command he was
the right man to remain in charge of the station. But the
acknowledgment did not make the necessity one whit less
detestable in his eyes; and to-night the two men's positions
were reversed. It was Paul who moved to and fro with long
restless strides; while Theo, enveloped in a cloud of blue
smoke, sat watching him in profound sympathy and
understanding, making occasional attempts at consolation,
with small result.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>During the next ten days Honor Meredith discovered how much
may be achieved and endured with the help of use and wont;
discovered also that habit is the rock on which man's soul
shall be wrecked or anchored in his evil day.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>
<p>She forced herself to speak of Theo more often than she had
done hitherto; for she now understood the reason of her
instinctive reserve where he was concerned; and the mere
effort of breaking through it was a help. She succeeded in
talking to him also, if with less frankness, still with
something of her old simplicity and ease; and in playing his
favourite preludes and sonatas, even though they stirred
unsounded depths of emotion, and made the burden laid upon
her shoulders seem too heavy to be borne.</p>

<p>One habit alone seriously hindered her. Her spirit of
candour&mdash;which was less a habit than an elemental
essence&mdash;chafed against the barrier between her and those
she loved. For she now found herself constrained to avoid
the too discerning eyes of Paul and Mrs Conolly, and, above
all, of Theo himself. Men and women whose spirit hibernates
more or less permanently in its temple of flesh have small
knowledge of the joy of such wordless intercourse; such
flashes of direct speech between soul and soul; but Honor
felt the lack of it keenly. She experienced, for the first
time in her life, that loneliness of heart which is an
integral part of all great sorrow.</p>

<p>But when things are at their worst we must needs eat and
sleep, and find some degree of satisfaction in both. Honor
was young, practical, healthy, and her days were too well
filled to allow of time for brooding; nor had she the
smallest leaning toward that unprofitable occupation. She
sought and found refuge from her clamorous Ego,&mdash;never more
clamorous than at the first awakening of love,&mdash;in
concentrating thought and purpose upon Evelyn; in bracing
her to meet this first real demand upon her courage in a
manner befitting Theo Desmond's wife.</p>

<p>And she reaped her measure of reward. Evelyn bore herself
bravely on the whole. Theo's manifest approbation acted as a
subconscious pillar of strength. But on the last day of all,
when the strain of standing morally on tiptoe was already
producing its inevitable effect, an unlooked-for shock
brought her back to earth with the rush of a wounded bird.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>
<p>The troops were to march at dawn; and in the evening it
transpired that Theo intended to dine at Mess, returning, in
all probability, just in time to change and ride down to the
Lines. The programme was so entirely a matter of course on
the eve of an expedition, and his squadron had absorbed so
much of his attention, that he had forgotten to speak of the
matter earlier; and the discovery was the last touch needed
to upset Evelyn's unstable equilibrium. Her collapse was the
more complete by reason of the strain that had gone before.</p>

<p>At the first she entreated him to give up the dinner and to
spend his last evening with her; and upon his gentle but
definite answer that such a departure from precedent was
hardly possible, she fell to sobbing with the passionate
unrestraint of a child. In vain Desmond tried to reason with
her, to assure her that these big nights on the eve of
active service were a time-honoured custom; and that all
married officers attended them as a matter of course.</p>

<p>"I would willingly stay at home to please you, Ladybird," he
added, "but the fellows would probably come round and carry
me off by main force. It would all be done in the way of a
joke, of course; but can't you see that any lack of
regimental spirit on my part is a reflection on you, which I
won't have at any price?"</p>

<p>No, she could see nothing, poor distracted child, except
that he was rewarding her cruelly ill for the genuine effort
at control she had made for his sake; and having once lost
hold upon herself, all the pent-up fears and rebellion, at
loss of him, found vent in a semi-coherent outbreak of
reproaches and tears, till Desmond finally lost his
patience, and went off to change for Mess in a mood of mind
ill-tuned to the boisterous night ahead of him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>
<p>"Big nights," an immemorial feature of army life, are a
specially marked feature of the Frontier, where the constant
recurrence of Border warfare, and the hardness of existence
generally, produce more frequent outbursts of the schoolboy
spirit that characterises the British soldier of all ranks;
that carries him unafraid and undismayed through
heart-breaking campaigns; keeps him cheerful and
uncomplaining in the face of flagrant mismanagement,
fell-climates, disaster, and defeat. Big nights, sixty years
ago, left a goodly number of men, either under the table or
in a condition only a few degrees less undignified. But, in
spite of the outcry against modern degeneration, these
things are not so to-day; and the big nights of the Frontier
Force, on the eve of active service, are singularly free
from this, the least admirable part of the programme.</p>

<p>The week before departure was necessarily a week of hard
work, culminating in the task of getting all details into
perfect marching order, and setting every item in readiness
for the start at dawn. This done, the British predilection
for "letting off steam" resulted in a night of uproarious
hilarity, incomprehensible to those ignorant of the
conditions which gave it birth, and unable to realise its
tonic effect on men who are setting out to face danger,
hardship, and possibly a violent death.</p>

<p>Wild games and contests were the order of the evening,&mdash;the
wilder the more acceptable. Cock-fighting, mock-polo
matches, or gymkhanas,&mdash;on such occasions nothing comes
amiss in the way of riotous foolishness pure and simple. The
senior officer forgets his seniority; the most dignified
lets fall the cloak of dignity for a few exhilarating hours.</p>

<p>Colonel Buchanan himself entered with zest into the maddest
innovations which Desmond or Olliver could devise; and those
who knew Paul Wyndham, in his normal habit as he lived,
would scarce have recognised him masquerading as Desmond's
polo pony, in a inter-regimental match played with billiard
balls, brother officers doing duty for mounts and cues for
polo-sticks. It was all excellent fooling; and the bar of
grey in the east came far too soon.</p>

<p>Close on five o'clock Desmond re-entered the bungalow; his
scarlet kummerbund disordered; his white mess-jacket in a
hundred creases; yet alert and ready in every fibre for the
day's march that lay before him.</p>

<p>The grey twilight of dawn was already creeping in through
the skylights and long glass doors, as he passed through the
drawing-room into his study.</p>

<p>Here he came to a standstill with a low exclamation of
surprise.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>
<p>On his cane deck-lounge Evelyn lay fast asleep, her face so
turned upon the cushion that its delicate profile showed
clear as a cameo against a background of dull blue. Her
white dinner dress gleamed ghostly in the dusk of morning.
One bronze slipper had fallen off; and one bare arm hung
limply over the chair's edge, the fingers curled softly
upwards. A slender chain bangle, with a turquoise pendant,
had almost slipped over her hand.</p>

<p>Desmond drew nearer with softened tread, and stood looking
down upon her, a world of tenderness in his
eyes;&mdash;tenderness touched with the reverence a finely
tempered man is apt to feel in the presence of a child or
woman asleep. For by some mysterious process sleep
sanctifies a face; perhaps because it is half brother to
death.</p>

<p>Evelyn's face was white as her dress, save for the coral
tint of her lips. Their downward droop, the red line along
her eyelids, and the moist handkerchief clutched in her
right hand, were more heart-stirring than tears.</p>

<p>He knelt down beside her and lightly caressed her hair.</p>

<p>"Ladybird," he said softly, "time to wake up."</p>

<p>His touch brought her back to life with an indrawn breath
like a sob; and at sight of him her arms went round his
neck.</p>

<p>"Theo, darling," she whispered, drawing his head down close
to hers. "I&mdash;was dreaming&mdash;that you were gone. I suppose you
are going very soon now?"</p>

<p>"Yes; in about an hour."</p>

<p>She held him closer.</p>

<p>"I was bad and selfish to you last night, Theo. I didn't
mean to be; but&mdash;I was. Honor made me understand."</p>

<p>"Bless her brave heart!" he said fervently. "She comes of
the best stock I know. By the way, I am sure she never told
you to spend the night here."</p>

<p>"No. She thought I had gone to bed. But I was too unhappy to
trouble about that&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You thought I might turn up before morning,&mdash;wasn't that
it?"</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;yes." She flushed softly on the confession.</p>

<p>"Poor dear little soul!"</p>

<p>He drew her to her feet, slipped on the fallen shoe, and put
his arm round her. "Come along to the dressing-room and help
me to get into my khaki."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>
<p>She walked beside him in so strange a confusion of
happiness and misery that it was impossible to say where one
ended and the other began. In the semi-darkness she tripped
and stumbled on the threshold, and he caught her close to
him, holding her thus for a long moment. Then he began to
dress.</p>

<p>At this point the long lean form of Amar Singh appeared in
the doorway. But at sight of the Memsahib, arrayed for
dinner, he departed as noiselessly as he had come; not
without a lurking sense of injury, since it was clearly his
privilege to do those last offices for his Sahib of twelve
years' standing.</p>

<p>Evelyn, anxious to show that she could be useful on
occasion, followed Theo to and fro like a shadow; handed him
the wrong thing at the wrong moment with pathetic
insistence; and hindered his progress by a host of
irrelevant questions. But some women can hinder more
engagingly than others can help; and in any case Theo
Desmond was in no humour to lose patience with his wife that
morning.</p>

<p>Once her attention was caught and held by Desmond's sword
and revolver, laid ready on a small table. She regarded them
with a kind of fearful fascination. They were no longer mere
ornaments of his uniform, but actual death-dealers, going
forth to do murderous work. The short blue muzzle of the
revolver had a sinister look, and a point of light at the
tip winked like a mocking eye.</p>

<p>"Theo," she said suddenly in an awestruck undertone, "do you
know what I was dreaming when you woke me? I dreamt that you
were fighting with Afridis,&mdash;ever so many of them,&mdash;and you
were all alone. I thought they were going to&mdash;kill you every
minute. They were running after you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Desmond dispelled the tragic vision with a shout of
laughter.</p>

<p>"They'll never get the chance to do <i>that</i>, Ladybird, so
long as I have the use of my bare hands, let alone my
sword!"</p>

<p>"But, Theo, just think, if you were all alone, and you were
bound to get killed if you stayed, and there was me at home
praying to get you back safe; wouldn't you be allowed to run
away&mdash;even then?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>
<p>Desmond smiled; but he did not answer at once. The
ludicrous suggestion, with its unconscious touch of pathos,
hurt him more than he cared to acknowledge.</p>

<p>"It isn't a case of being allowed," he said. "I should never
be left quite alone like that; and anyway, they don't lay
down a code of morals for us in the Queen's Regulations. It
is understood that a British officer will play the man, even
in desperate straits."</p>

<p>She knitted her brows wistfully. "Yes, of course. Only&mdash;it
seems rather hard on&mdash;the wives and mothers."</p>

<p>"You never said a truer word, little woman. That's why they
need to have such good grit in them,&mdash;don't you see?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I see. But mayn't you just get out of the way of a
bullet if you happen to see it coming?"</p>

<p>Desmond shook his head.</p>

<p>"One generally happens to feel it before one gets a chance
of seeing it," he said. "But now, let's have done with
nonsense. Buckle on my sword and we'll go to breakfast. The
whole house is astir."</p>

<p>She set the leathern belt round his waist, and tried to
fasten it; but her fingers trembled in spite of herself, and
a mist blinded her eyes. He took the heavy strap from her
very gently, and fastened it himself.</p>

<p>"You won't change and ride out a little way with us as the
others mean to?" he asked.</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no; I couldn't. I don't want to make you ashamed of me,
Theo."</p>

<p>For answer he held out his arms; and there was a long
silence in the dimly lighted room.</p>

<p>Then he led her to the door of their room, and himself went
out to the breakfast-table with a brisk elasticity of tread.
He would not have been the man he was, if even the pang of
parting could altogether quench his ardour to be gone.</p>

<p>In the dining-room he found Honor ready equipped for the
start. She looked paler than usual, and there were blue
shadows under her eyes; but she answered his greeting
cheerfully enough, and busied herself with pouring out his
tea.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ladybird is changing into a morning gown," he explained.
"She never went to bed last night poor child!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish I had known that! I did my best to comfort her."</p>

<p>"So she told me: and you succeeded. You generally do."</p>

<p>He glanced at her thoughtfully, a shade of anxiety in his
eyes. "You're not looking as fit yourself as you did a
fortnight ago," he said.</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense," she answered with a touch of
impatience.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope it may be nonsense. But I feel responsible for
you. Take good care of yourself, please, while I am away;
and&mdash;take care of my Ladybird as well.... Hullo, there's
Paul!"</p>

<p>Wyndham entered as he spoke, wearing the undress uniform of
station life: and Honor had seldom been so glad to see him
as at that moment.</p>

<p>The two men stood facing one another for quite a long time.
Then they smiled, and sat down to breakfast. Both knew that
in that long look they had said all that need ever be said
between them and it sufficed.</p>

<p>Evelyn came in a few minutes later, pale and subdued, but
not uncheerful. Her real sorrow, and no less real
determination to control it, gave a rare touch of dignity to
the grace and simplicity that were hers by nature;&mdash;a fact
which her husband was quick to perceive and admire. Both
men, by a natural instinct, were a trifle more attentive to
her than usual, without the least hint of intrusion upon the
privacy of her grief; and it is in just such acts of
unobtrusive chivalry that Englishmen, of the best type,
stand unrivalled throughout the world.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>
<p>The meal over, Evelyn accompanied them into the verandah,
and stood smiling and waving her hand to them as they rode
away, with a composure born of a stunned sense of the
unreality of it all. Theo was just going down to the Lines,
and he would be back to tiffin as a matter of course.
Nevertheless, half an hour later the rims of her eyes were
again reddened with weeping: and donning a sun-hat, she
hurried out to a point where she could watch the little
force move across the space of open country between the
cantonment and the bastioned fort that stands at the
entrance to the hills.</p>

<p>By the time Evelyn reached her coign of vantage, the
cavalcade was already nearing the prescribed mile where the
final parting would take place, to the strains of "Auld Lang
Syne"; a piece of gratuitous torment, honoured by custom,
which many would have willingly foregone.</p>

<p>The slowly retreating mass, half enveloped in dust, showed a
few shades darker than the desert itself. A patch of
vermilion indicated the Pioneer band, now blaring forth,
with placid unconcern, "The Girl I Left Behind Me!" Lesser
specks denoted officers, riding out, like the rest of the
station, to speed the parting troops.</p>

<p>The cavalry riding in the van were a mere moving dust-cloud,
followed by artillery, infantry, ambulance doolies, borne by
half-naked Kahars; while a jumble of men and animals,
camp-followers and transport, formed, as it were, a
disorderly tail to the more compact body. Camels, groaning
under tent-poles and heavy baggage, shuffled and swayed on
the outskirts, with leisurely contempt; grass-cutters bobbed
cheerfully along on ponies of no birth or breeding, that
appeared oddly misshapen under vast loads of grass: and at
the last came miniature transport carts, closely followed by
the rear-guard, a mixed body of all arms.</p>

<p>While Evelyn still watched, the halt was called, and the
disturbing strains of parting reached her where she stood.
Hill, plain, and nearer objects lost their crispness of
outline; and she went back to the silent house awaiting
her,&mdash;the lively strains of the return march already
sounding in her ears.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>
<p>As she stood still for a moment, fighting against her
emotion, Owen Kresney rode past. She barely acknowledged his
greeting; and he had the tact to pass on without speech. For
the man saw plainly that the coveted opportunity for
striking a blow at Desmond, behind his back, was very near
at hand; and he could afford to bide his time.</p>

<h4>THE DEVIL'S PECULIARITY?</h4>

<div class="blockpoem">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"This is the devil's peculiarity, he attacks us
             through our softest places."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 21em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sudermann.</span></span><br />
<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the departure of the troops, life settled down
gradually into its normal groove.</p>

<p>Frank Olliver had moved into the blue bungalow, at Desmond's
request, an arrangement more satisfying to Honor than to his
wife; and the Pioneer Regiment from Pindi had added a couple
of ladies to the station. These were made welcome with the
prompt friendliness which is India's distinctive charm; and
the bachelors, in due course, made the circuit of Kohat's
handful of bungalows. The station was a few degrees less
cheerful, owing to the absence of its own particular men;
but in India spirits must be kept up at all costs, if only
as an antidote to the moral microbes of the land; and the
usual small sociabilities flourished accordingly.</p>

<p>Evelyn took part in these at first with a chastened air. Not
that she assumed what she did not feel; but that her grief,
when it reached a less acute stage, gave her a soothing
sense of importance; a kind of dismal distinction, such as a
child feels in the possession of a badly cut finger or a
loose tooth. The wind bloweth where it listeth; and such
thistledown natures are entirely at its mercy. They cannot
take deep root, even where they would. For them the near
triumphs over the far. Like Esau, they will sell their
birthright cheerfully for a mess of pottage; and they are
the raw material of half the tragedies in the world.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus, with the passing of uneventful days, Evelyn began to
find it rather uninteresting to be quietly and comfortably
unhappy; and the aspect of subdued plaintiveness which she
half consciously adopted was, in truth, singularly becoming.
She was one of those favoured women who have the good
fortune to do most things becomingly. Her very tears became
her, as dewdrops do a rose.</p>

<p>Frank commented on the fact to Honor, in characteristic
fashion.</p>

<p>"Sure, 'tis a thousand pities we can't all of us look so
pretty when we put on a melancholy face! It makes me look
such a scarecrow meself, that I'm bound to keep on smiling,
out o' sheer vanity, even if me heart's in two!"</p>

<p>"That's one way of putting it," Honor answered, with a very
soft light in her eyes. She had begun to understand lately
that this brave woman was by no means so inured to the
hardship and danger of the men she loved as she would fain
have them and the world believe: and the two drew very near
to one another in these weeks of eager looking for news from
the hills.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that Kresney failed to observe the
gradual change in Evelyn's bearing. The man displayed
remarkable tact and skill in detecting the psychological
moment for advance. He contented himself at first with
conversations in the Club Gardens and an air of deferential
sympathy, which was in itself a subtle form of flattery. But
on a certain afternoon of regimental sports, when Evelyn
appeared, radiant and smiling, in one of her most
irresistible Simla frocks, with an obviously appreciative
Pioneer subaltern in attendance, Kresney perceived that the
time to assert himself had arrived.</p>

<p>After a short but decisive engagement, he routed that
indignant subaltern; and with a quiet assurance which by no
means displeased her, took and kept possession of Mrs
Desmond for the remainder of the afternoon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>
<p>That evening he enjoyed his after-dinner cigar as he had
not enjoyed it for many weeks. Mrs Desmond was obviously
tired of her pretty pathetic pose; and he intended to avail
himself to the utmost of her rebound towards
lightheartedness. He flattered himself that he read her like
an open book; that she would be as wax in his hands if he
chose to push his advantage. But for all his acuteness, he
failed to detect the one good grain hid in a bushel of
chaff; or to perceive that it was not indifference, but the
very burden of her anxiety, that drove Evelyn to seek
distraction in the form of any amusement lying near to her
hand.</p>

<p>Letters from the Samana were few and brief. The last ones
had brought news that the expedition seemed likely to prove
a more serious affair than had been anticipated. Unknown to
Honor, Evelyn cried herself to sleep that night, and awoke
to the decision that she would not be so foolishly unhappy
any more. She would shut her eyes to the haunting horrors,
and forget. Theo had forbidden her to make herself too
miserable. Why should she not obey him? And she proceeded to
do so in her own equivocal fashion.</p>

<p>After the first effort it was fatally easy to slip back into
the old habit of accepting Kresney's companionship, and his
frequent invitations to the house;&mdash;fatally easy to slip
even a few degrees farther without the smallest suspicion of
his hand on the reins. She took to riding with
him&mdash;sometimes in the early mornings, sometimes in the
evenings; and these leisurely rides&mdash;for Evelyn was no
horsewoman&mdash;suited Kresney's taste infinitely better than
tennis. By cautious degrees they increased in frequency and
duration; till it became evident to the least observant that
little Mrs Desmond was consoling herself to good purpose.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>
<p>Honor watched the new trend of events with suppressed wrath
and disgust. That a woman who had won the love of Theo
Desmond should descend, even for passing amusement, upon
such a travesty of manhood, roused in her a bitterness of
rebellion which she had no right to feel; but which, being
only human, she could not altogether banish from her heart.
Nor were matters made easier by Frank Olliver's periodical
outbursts on the subject. The hot-headed Irishwoman had a
large share of the unreasoning prejudice of her race. She
hated as she loved, wholesale, and without reason. She could
make no shadow of excuse for Evelyn Desmond; and was only
restrained from speaking out her mind by a wholesome fear of
her own temper, and a desire to avoid a serious breach with
Theo Desmond's wife. But with Honor it was otherwise. Honor,
she maintained, had a right to speak, and no right to be
silent; and goaded thus, the girl did at length make a
tentative effort at remonstrance.</p>

<p>But upon her first words Evelyn flushed hotly.</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake, Honor, don't start interfering again!"
she said, in a tone which effectually quenched further
discussion.</p>

<p>Thus, without definite intention, they drifted a little
apart. Honor, haunted by a sense of having failed Theo at a
time of need, found what consolation she might in her
growing intimacy with Paul Wyndham; while Evelyn went on her
way unchallenged, blind to every consideration but the need
of escape from the haunting dread that she would never see
her husband again. The dissonance between her feelings and
her actions troubled her no whit. Her notions of loyalty
were peculiar and inconsistent, like herself; and it is
probable that she never gave a thought to Kresney's
interpretation of her conduct, or to the dangerous nature of
the game she was playing.</p>

<p>The man himself was well content, and increasingly
self-satisfied. He could be an intelligent and mildly
amusing companion, when it served his turn; and he was
beginning to lose sight of Desmond in keen enjoyment of the
oldest pastime in the world. They fell into occasional
spells of silence now as they rode&mdash;silence such as
familiarity breeds, and which is not without a degree of
danger at a certain stage of intimacy between a man and a
woman.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>
<p>They had been riding thus, for some time, on an afternoon
of early March. Their horses' heads had been turned
homeward; for the sun was near to setting, and on the
Frontier it is unsafe to be out after dusk. Evelyn's reins
lay loose upon the grey mare's neck and her long lashes
shadowed her cheek. She seemed to have forgotten her
companion's presence. Kresney's eyes rested speculatively on
her finely chiselled profile. He found her, on close
acquaintance, more charming than he had expected. She
possessed an elusiveness that captivates more surely than
beauty. A man could never feel quite certain of her. She had
not been in a very "coming-on disposition" that afternoon.
His interest was piqued in consequence, and he was in the
mood to dare a good deal.</p>

<p>He would have given much to know what she was thinking of;
and the knowledge would have administered a wholesome shock
to his vanity. He decided to surprise her with the question,
and read the answer in her too expressive face.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the absorbing subject?" he demanded suddenly. His
tone was a sufficient index of his progress during the past
fortnight.</p>

<p>She flushed and laughed softly, without looking up; and he
drew his own conclusions.</p>

<p>"I don't tell my thoughts! But I'm sorry if I was rude. I
was thinking, for one thing," she added lightly and
mendaciously, "that I wish it was nearer time to go up to
the Hills."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder at that. You're wasted in a place like
Kohat."</p>

<p>"That's rubbish!" she rebuked him. But her pleasure in the
words was self-evident.</p>

<p>"And that's modesty!" he capped her promptly, enjoying the
deepening carnation of the cheek turned towards him. "Will
it be Murree again this year?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I suppose so." She spoke without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you prefer Simla?"</p>

<p>"Well, naturally&mdash;a thousand times."</p>

<p>"Then why not go there? I would come up too, like a shot. I
can get a couple of months this year, and we'd have a
ripping time of it. Shall we call it settled&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>She sighed and shook her head.</p>

<p>"It's too expensive. Besides, there seems to be something
wrong with Simla. My husband doesn't like it much; nor does
Honor."</p>

<p>The implication in Kresney's laugh was lost upon Evelyn
Desmond.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, of course Simla isn't much of a place for
husbands," he explained loftily, "or for girls. It's the
bachelors who have a good time there,&mdash;<i>and</i> the married
women."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>
<p>"Is it? How odd! I should think anybody who cared about
dancing and acting, and all that sort of thing, would be
bound to have a lovely time in Simla."</p>

<p>She looked him so simply and straightly in the face that he
felt unaccountably ashamed of his questionable remark, and
the laugh that had preceded it&mdash;a sensation to which he was
little accustomed.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; daresay you're right," he agreed airily. "But if
you're so keen about the place, why not insist upon going?
Wives don't trouble overmuch about obedience nowadays; most
of them seem to do whatever they please."</p>

<p>"Do they? Well, then, I suppose it pleases me to go where my
husband likes best."</p>

<p>"Very dutiful, indeed!" A shadow of a sneer lurked beneath
his bantering tone, and she reddened again.</p>

<p>"It's not dutiful at all. It's simply because&mdash;&mdash;" She broke
off short. "Oh, I think you're horrid this afternoon. I
expect people to make themselves pleasant when I let them
come out with me."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure I do my best. But one can never tell where
to have you. Goodness knows I've shown you plainly that I'm
ready to be your friend&mdash;to any extent; and you've seemed to
accept it readily enough&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, of course. I like men to like me. I always did&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Men?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, men," she nodded, smiling. "I don't trouble much about
women&mdash;except Honor; and <i>she's</i> worth all the men in
creation put together."</p>

<p>"Desmond included?" Again the covert sneer lurked in his
tone, and she drew herself up with a pretty air of dignity.</p>

<p>"That's not any concern of yours."</p>

<p>"But I tell you it is!" He pressed closer. "More than you've
chosen to realise so far. D'you suppose you can go on
indefinitely blowing hot and cold with a man; snubbing him
one minute and drawing him on the next?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh dear! Oh dear! I never bother to suppose things!
Haven't I said that if you want me to be nice, you mustn't
plague me with stupid questions? At any rate, you're seeing
a lot of me now. And you're riding a lot with me now&mdash;isn't
that enough?"</p>

<p>"No. It's not enough, Mrs Desmond&mdash;Evelyn&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hush&mdash;hush! You mustn't say that!" she murmured
ineffectually; but he paid no heed.</p>

<p>"You find this sort of thing pleasant enough while Desmond's
away; but <i>will</i> you keep it up when he comes back? Tell me
that&mdash;&mdash;" He leaned closer; but she turned her head away,
avoiding his gaze.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. How can I possibly tell?" she answered,
half plaintively, half petulantly. "Why <i>are</i> men so
tiresome? They never seem able to enjoy things peaceably
without making tragedies and getting too much in
earnest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But how if I am in earnest&mdash;in desperate earnest?"</p>

<p>He spoke with sudden vehemence. Something in his tone
startled her into a recollection of the incident at Lahore.
And there was no Theo at hand to protect her now.</p>

<p>Forgetful of the loosened rein, and of her insecure hold on
the stirrup, she struck the mare more sharply than she knew.
The astonished animal bounded forward, stumbled on a round
stone, and came down on her knees, pitching Evelyn over her
head into the dust of the metalled road.</p>

<p>Kresney stifled an oath. "What the devil did the little fool
do that for?" he muttered between his teeth.</p>

<p>Springing to the ground, he shouted to a passing native
child to hold the two horses, and hurried to Evelyn's side,
reflecting as he went that, if she were not seriously
injured, the accident might have its advantages. She was on
her knees when he reached her, and was pressing both hands
to her temples.</p>

<p>"Are you badly hurt?" he asked, anger banished by real
anxiety.</p>

<p>"I don't&mdash;know. Oh&mdash;my head&mdash;my head!"</p>

<p>The words ended in a sob; she swayed as if she would fall,
and quick as thought his arm went round her, pressing her
close. But at his touch she recovered herself as if by
magic; and pushing him fiercely aside, staggered panting to
her feet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>
<p>Kresney stood regarding her for a moment, an evil
expression in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned!" he broke out at length. "I'm not a
disease that you should shake me off in that fashion."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she said with quick-coming breaths. "You meant
to be kind, I know, but&mdash;don't touch me again, please."</p>

<p>"I only wanted to keep you from falling in the dust," he
retorted huffily.</p>

<p>"I know. But&mdash;I would rather fall in the dust."</p>

<p>She spoke almost in a whisper, yet with such obvious
sincerity that he set his teeth viciously and answered
nothing.</p>

<p>She remained standing before him, helpless, tantalising,
unapproachable, in her childlike dignity. Her head was dazed
and throbbing. Her knees shook under her so persistently
that she gave it up at last, and sank down in the road,
covering her face with her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, how <i>am</i> I going to get home?" she moaned, more to
herself than to him.</p>

<p>He came and stood near her again. He was surprised to find
how keenly her distress hurt him, and now that his anger was
past, her flash of independence made her more alluring than
ever.</p>

<p>"If you won't let me lay a finger on you," he said in an
altered tone, "I don't see how I can be any use. But if you
will condescend to use me as a prop, I'll put you up on the
mare, and walk beside you; then you can hold on to me if you
feel shaky. We are not far off now, and the boy can take my
pony on. Will that suit you?"</p>

<p>She looked up gratefully through a mist of tears.</p>

<p>"Thank you. It is nice of you to be so kind to me
after&mdash;what I said."</p>

<p>"No man in his senses could be anything but kind to <i>you</i>."
And bending down he once more encircled her with his arm,
raising her to her feet, and taking his time over the
proceeding. For an instant, in mere weakness, she leaned her
light weight upon him; and his sense of triumph was
complete.</p>

<p>"No hurry," he assured her gently. "You're very shaky still,
you know."</p>

<p>But she stiffened at the cautious tightening of his arm, and
stumbled forward, so that he had some ado to repress his
irritation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>
<p>He lifted her to the saddle; and, seemingly oblivious that
he had offered himself as a mere prop, took such full
advantage of the permission to support her till they reached
the bungalow, that she was vaguely troubled, though too
dazed and shaken to attempt further remonstrance.</p>

<p>"May I come in?" he asked, as he set her on the ground.</p>

<p>"Yes, please come. Won't you stay to dinner?"</p>

<p>"I should like to, awfully."</p>

<p>"Very well then, do."</p>

<p>She managed to walk into the drawing-room; but as he laid
her on the sofa, her head fell limply backward, and she
fainted.</p>

<p>He stood watching her intently for a few seconds. Then he
bent over her, low and lower, till his lips almost rested
upon hers. But at this point something checked his
despicable impulse&mdash;perhaps the purity of her face, or
merely its unresisting stillness. Perhaps he chose to defer
the pleasure till a more acceptable moment. He straightened
himself with a jerk; and hastening into the hall, shouted
for brandy and soda-water.</p>

<p>Very soon a faint colour crept back into her cheeks. She
opened her eyes and smiled up at him.</p>

<p>"Drink some of this," he said. "It's very weak, and you need
it."</p>

<p>She took a few sips and set down the glass.</p>

<p>"Better now?" he asked, and leaned over her again, his hand
on the sofa back, his lips perilously close to her hair. At
that critical moment, Wyndham's tall figure appeared in the
doorway, closely followed by Honor Meredith.</p>

<p>Kresney's back was towards him; and the tableau presented by
the pair was equivocal, to say the least of it. For an
instant Paul stood still in sheer stupefaction; then he
turned to the girl, his grey eyes ablaze with indignation,
and she had never liked him better than at that moment.</p>

<p>As he stepped forward, Kresney started up with a stifled
oath; and the two men confronted one another, in silent,
undisguised hostility, while Honor hurried to Evelyn's side.</p>

<p>"What is wrong with Mrs Desmond?" Paul asked coldly,
concealing his natural anxiety for Theo's wife.</p>

<p>"Oh, she has had a spill. The mare came down with her; and
she fainted when I got her home."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>
<p>Kresney's pronounced frigidity was more ludicrous than
impressive; and the shadow of a smile lurked beneath Paul's
moustache as he addressed himself to Honor.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be well to send for Conolly?" he asked. But
Evelyn interposed.</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;no,&mdash;I don't want Dr Conolly. I'm all right now."</p>

<p>She raised herself on her elbow in proof of her statement.</p>

<p>"Mr Kresney was very kind to me. I have asked him to dinner.
Won't you stay too?"</p>

<p>"Thanks. I'll go and change, and come back later. You will
do the same, I presume?" And he looked directly at Kresney,
who had wit enough to perceive that the situation was
untenable.</p>

<p>"It's very good of you to want me, Mrs Desmond," he said,
elaborately ignoring Wyndham's remark, "but I'd better not
stop to-night. You won't be fit for much talking after that
nasty tumble."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. You must come some other night instead. I
won't forget."</p>

<p>She held out her hand with marked graciousness, flashing a
defiant glance at Paul, who, in sublime unconsciousness,
followed Kresney out into the verandah, and remained
standing on the steps till he had ridden out of sight.</p>

<p>No words passed between them except a mutually formal
"Good-night." But Paul succeeded in conveying the impression
that he regarded himself as Desmond's representative; and in
making Kresney feel more acutely uncomfortable than he had
felt for many a long day. If he had done no actual harm, the
fault did not lie with him; and his conscience sprang
painfully to life under the lash of Wyndham's contemptuous
silence.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room, conversation fared little better.</p>

<p>"Why on earth was Major Wyndham so dignified and
disagreeable?" Evelyn queried in a tone of frank annoyance.
"It isn't <i>his</i> affair."</p>

<p>"You seem to forget that he is Theo's oldest friend."</p>

<p>Restrained anger quivered in the girl's low voice.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>
<p>"He has news for you&mdash;from the Samana," she added. "There
has been sharp fighting. Theo's squadron has done a very
dashing bit of work;&mdash;Major Wyndham will tell you about it,
<i>if</i> you care to hear. Now you had better lie quiet till you
dress for dinner." And without waiting for an answer she
left the room.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Next morning, while she sat at work, wondering how she could
broach the forbidden subject, Evelyn herself came and stood
before her with a purposeful air of decision.</p>

<p>"Honor," she said, "I don't want anybody to say anything
to&mdash;Theo about my accident. Do you see? It is my business to
tell him, and not any one else's. Will you let Mrs Olliver
know that, please? I don't care to speak to her about it
myself."</p>

<p>Honor glanced up quickly.</p>

<p>"No, Evelyn; it would be just as well not. She happened to
be crossing this hill yesterday when you and Mr Kresney were
on the lower road; and&mdash;she saw you together."</p>

<p>"Just the sort of thing she <i>would</i> do! I hate Mrs Olliver!
Always spying on me; and I dare say she won't believe the
truth even now. But I won't have her talking to <i>Theo</i> about
me, whatever she may imagine."</p>

<p>"You know her very little if you think she could do that,"
Honor answered quietly. "She only spoke to me because she
fancies I have influence with you. But that seems to be over
now. You have chosen to go your own way. It is a very
dangerous way. However, I can say nothing more on the
subject."</p>

<p>Evelyn choked back her rising tears.</p>

<p>"Honor, can't you <i>see</i> that&mdash;that I'm frightened and
miserable about Theo, and I must have something to help me
forget? It's no use trying to make <i>you</i> understand how it
feels to have him away up there&mdash;always in danger&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Honor started and flushed. "Indeed, dear, I do understand,"
she answered, not quite steadily.</p>

<p>Evelyn shook her head.</p>

<p>"You think you do, but you can't really. I know you are
great friends with him, and you'd be very sorry if&mdash;if
anything happened. But it's ever so much worse for me,
because I am&mdash;his wife. Now I must go and write to him about
all this."</p>

<p>And Honor, left alone, leaned back in her chair, hiding her
face in her hands.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>
<p>"God forgive me!" she murmured. "How dare <i>I</i> find fault
with her, blessed child that she is!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul Wyndham's</span> hopes were on the ascendant at last. After a
full year of waiting, he saw himself drawing steadily nearer
to his hour of reward.</p>

<p>He studied Honor Meredith as a man only studies that on
which his life's happiness depends; and during the past few
weeks he had become aware of a mysterious change in the
girl's bearing. Her beauty&mdash;which had seemed to him so
complete&mdash;was now unmistakably enhanced by some
transformation within. Her whole nature seemed to have
become more highly sensitised. Her colour came and went upon
the least provocation; her frank friendliness was veiled by
a shy reserve, that had in it no hint of coldness; and, more
significant than all, her eyes no longer met his own with
that disconcerting directness of gaze which had sealed his
lips when they were upon the verge of speech.</p>

<p>For all his modesty, Wyndham could not fail to interpret
these signs according to his heart's desire; and when, on
the night of Evelyn's accident, Honor promised him an early
ride, prefaced by <i>chota hazri</i><a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> in the verandah, he told
himself that he need wait no longer&mdash;that the great moment
of his life had come at last.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>
<p>On the stroke of seven he mounted the verandah steps. A
camp table, set with fruit, freshly made toast, and a
tea-tray, awaited him in a shadowed corner. Two thick bamboo
blinds, let down between the wide arches, converted that end
of the verandah into a room, its low-toned coolness broken
only by an arrow of sunlight, shooting through a gap in one
of the blinds, like a streak of powdered gold. Wyndham's
eyes lingered approvingly on every detail of the homely
scene; and he caught himself wondering what his sensations
would be half an hour hence; what words he should speak to
her when the dreaded, longed-for moment arrived.</p>

<p>A light footstep reached his ears; and he turned sharply
round to find her standing in the open doorway.</p>

<p>She did not come forward at once, nor did she speak. For the
man's face was transfigured. She beheld, in that instant,
his unveiled heart and spirit&mdash;foresaw the ordeal that
awaited her.</p>

<p>Noting her hesitation, he came forward with unconcealed
eagerness.</p>

<p>"Good morning," she murmured mechanically. There seemed
nothing else that could be said.</p>

<p>Then a wave of colour surged into her face; for he kept the
hand she gave him, and drew her towards the privacy of the
tea-table. She would have sacrificed much at that moment for
the power to speak to prevent the pain she was bound to
inflict; but her heart seemed to be beating in her throat;
and she endured, as best she might, the controlled intensity
of his look and tone.</p>

<p>"You know&mdash;surely you know what I find it so hard to say&mdash;I
love you,&mdash;Honor, with all there is of me. I want you&mdash;God
knows how I want you! And&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>He bent his head to receive the answer that need not be
spoken in words. But all vestige of colour was gone from her
face, and the unsteadiness of her beautiful mouth cut him to
the heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, forgive me!" she pleaded. "I have been thoughtless,
selfish,&mdash;blind. But you seemed so entirely my friend&mdash;I did
not guess. I would have given the world to have spared
you&mdash;<i>this</i>."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>
<p>He straightened himself like a man under the lash; but he
did not relinquish her hand.</p>

<p>"I can't let you reproach yourself," he said quietly,
"because I misunderstood signs that seemed to tell me your
heart was awake at last. But now&mdash;now you know how it is
with me, at least you will let me hope&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I wish I might," she answered, so low that he could
scarcely hear. "But&mdash;it's impossible!"</p>

<p>"Am I so entirely unworthy&mdash;unlovable?"</p>

<p>"No, oh no. It is not that."</p>

<p>"D'you mean&mdash;I was not mistaken. Is there&mdash;any one else?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>It was impossible to lie to him, and the blood rushed back
into her face at the confession.</p>

<p>"Is he <i>here</i>?" Paul demanded, with sudden energy.</p>

<p>"You mustn't ask any questions about&mdash;him&mdash;about it,
please."</p>

<p>"Only this one. Shall you&mdash;marry him?"</p>

<p>"No. Never."</p>

<p>Sheer incredulity held him silent; and when he spoke there
was rebellion in his tone.</p>

<p>"Your life and my own are to remain broken, unfulfilled,
because of&mdash;this incomprehensible thing?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing else possible."</p>

<p>He relinquished her hand at that, giving it back to her, as
it were, with a quiet finality of renunciation that
shattered her self-control. She sank into a chair and hid
her face in a vain attempt to conceal the tears that came in
spite of herself.</p>

<p>He stood beside her for several seconds in a heart-broken
silence; then gently touched her arm.</p>

<p>"Honor&mdash;Honor, is it really so impossible&mdash;as you think? I
tell you plainly I can't understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She uncovered her face and looked up at him.</p>

<p>"Can any one ever understand&mdash;this sort of thing? Isn't it a
force outside the control of reason, of even the strongest
will?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>
<p>"You are right," he answered gravely; and sitting down
leaned towards her, his elbows on the table. "But there
remains the fact that sooner than lose you outright, I am
willing to marry you&mdash;on any terms. If you have no hope for
yourself, could you not bring yourself to partially fulfil
mine? Will you&mdash;in mercy to me&mdash;reconsider your decision?"</p>

<p>She looked up quickly with parted lips; but his raised hand
enjoined silence.</p>

<p>"My suggestion deserves thinking over for a few minutes, if
no longer. And in the meanwhile&mdash;" he smiled with a touch of
his old humorous resignation to things in general&mdash;"we might
do worse than have some <i>chota hazri</i>. What a brute I was to
upset you before you had had a morsel to eat!"</p>

<p>She shook her head, with a faint reflection of his smile.</p>

<p>"I don't want anything to eat."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you do! I suppose I must set you an example of
common-sense behaviour."</p>

<p>He peeled two bananas with deliberate care, and set one on
her plate. Then he lifted the cosy.</p>

<p>"That tea must be strong by this time; but the water's hot,
and you can doctor it with that. Now&mdash;begin."</p>

<p>He himself began upon his banana, and she glanced at him in
astonishment, not untinged with admiration, at his
effortless transition from controlled passion to the
commonplaces of everyday life. They got through the short
meal after a fashion; and both were devoutly thankful when
the demands of common-sense had been fulfilled.</p>

<p>Wyndham rose, and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Now, I'll leave you to yourself for five minutes," he
announced. "It is getting late. But before we go for our
ride this matter must be settled once for all." He laid both
hands on the table and looked steadily into her face. "You
are the most just-minded woman I know. Look all round the
question before you decide. Try to realise a little what it
will mean for me to give up all hope. In losing you, I lose
everything. There can be no question of any one else for me.
Take me or&mdash;leave me, I am <i>yours</i> for the rest of my life."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>
<p>He turned away to save her from the necessity of answering,
and walked to the far end of the verandah, leaving her alone
with the strongest temptation she had yet experienced&mdash;the
temptation to trample on her own imperious love, and to
accept this man's selfless devotion in the hope that it
might one day conquer and monopolise her heart.</p>

<p>Had marriage with Wyndham entailed immediate removal from
the atmosphere of Theo Desmond, hesitancy might have ended
in capitulation. But life-long intimacy with him, as the
wife of his closest friend, was unthinkable for a moment;
and if by the wildest possibility Paul should ever suspect
the truth&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>She shuddered and glanced in his direction.</p>

<p>"Major Wyndham," she said softly.</p>

<p>He hastened back to her at once. But one look at her face
sufficed. The eagerness faded from his eyes, leaving them
cold as a winter sky after sunset.</p>

<p>"It was wrong of me to keep you in suspense even for a few
minutes," she said, her gaze riveted on the table. "Please
forgive me that I am driven to hurt you so, and please
believe that I do realise what I am losing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The loss is&mdash;not yours," he said on a note of restrained
quietness: and in the stillness that ensued, the impatient
horses could be heard champing their bits.</p>

<p>He sank into his chair with a gesture of unfeigned
weariness; and she glanced at his face. Its mingled pain and
patience pierced her heart. But when at last he spoke, his
voice was natural and controlled.</p>

<p>"I have only one word more to say. I confess I have not the
courage to let you go altogether out of my life. Since
nothing else is possible, will you at least accept me as
your permanent and&mdash;devoted friend?"</p>

<p>She turned upon him in frank surprise.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that&mdash;really? <i>Can</i> you do it? Men always
say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He smiled a trifle bitterly.</p>

<p>"Do they? No doubt they are right&mdash;for themselves. But I
know I have the strength to accept what I ask, or I would
not dare ask it. You won't refuse me that much, will
you&mdash;Honor?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, no," she answered, greatly moved. "I can deny
you nothing that I am not forced to deny you&mdash;Paul."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ah, there is no woman in the world to compare with you!
Let me say it this once, as I may never tell you so again."</p>

<p>He rose in speaking, braced his shoulders, and stood looking
down upon her, a strangely glad light in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I have <i>not</i> lost you, after all," he said.</p>

<p>She rose also, and gave him both her hands. "No. You have
gained me&mdash;for good. I&mdash;care now ever so much more than I
did when I came out to you this morning."</p>

<p>"You <i>do</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I do."</p>

<p>He drew her towards him. "Promise me this much," he said,
"that if you should ever find it possible to&mdash;marry me on
any conditions&mdash;even the hardest&mdash;you will tell me so at
once, because after this morning I shall never open my lips
on the subject again."</p>

<p>"I promise. Only&mdash;you must not let yourself hope."</p>

<p>He sighed. "Very well, I will shut out hope, since you
command it. But I shall still have love and faith to live
upon. You cannot deprive me of those&mdash;Honor. Now shall we go
for our ride? Or would you rather go in and rest after all
this?"</p>

<p>"No. We will have our ride. I can rest later if I need it."</p>

<p>"Let me put you up then. Come."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>
<p>And she came without a word.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> second week in March found the little force from Kohat
still skirmishing energetically through a network of
ravines, nullahs, and jagged red hills; still dealing out
rough justice to unrepentant Afridis in accordance with
instructions from headquarters; or as nearly in accordance
with them as Colonel Buchanan's pronounced views on the
ethics of warfare would permit. For Buchanan was a just man
of independent character, a type not ostentatiously beloved
by heads of departments. He had a reprehensible trick of
thinking for himself and acting accordingly&mdash;a habit liable
to create havoc among the card-houses of officialdom; and
like all soldiers of the first grade, he was resolute
against the cowardly method of striking at the guilty
through the innocent; resolute in limiting the evils of war
to its authors and active abettors.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>
<p>He had taken full advantage of his temporary rank to run
the expedition on his own lines; and although his
instructions included the burning of crops, he had kept
rigid control over this part of the programme; giving
officers and men free scope for activity in the demolishing
of armed forts and towers, and in skirmishes with the wild
tribes who harried their transport trains, rushed their
pickets, sent playful bullets whizzing through the mess-tent
at night, and generally enjoyed themselves after the rough
and ready fashion of the hillsman across the Border.</p>

<p>The Afridis in truth were merely tired of behaving like good
children. The unstained knives at their belts cried shame on
them for their prolonged abstinence from the legitimate joys
of manhood;&mdash;the music of bullets whistling down a gorge,
the yielding of an enemy's flesh under the knife.</p>

<p>Therefore, when Colonel Buchanan and his little force
started punitive operations, they were met by a surprisingly
concerted and spirited resistance. The cunning tribesmen,
having got what they wanted in the shape of excitement, were
determined to make the most of it. Thus, the expedition had
flared up into one of those minor guerilla campaigns which
have cost England more, in the lives of picked officers,
than she is ever likely to calculate; being, for the most
part, careful and troubled about weightier matters.</p>

<p>The sweeping movement, organised to include all villages
implicated in the raid, took longer than had been
anticipated. The demolishing of Afridi watch-towers, manned
by the finest natural marksmen in the world, and built on
bases proof against everything but gunpowder, is no child's
play; and at almost every village on the line of route the
troops had found their work cut out for them. That they
carried it out gallantly and effectively need hardly be
said, since we are dealing with the pick of India's
soldiers, the Punjab Frontier Force.</p>

<p>Their daily march led them along broken tracks or
boulder-strewn beds of torrents, winding through a land
where "the face of God is a rock";&mdash;a land feigning death,
yet alive with hidden foes who announced their presence from
time to time by the snick of a breech-bolt, the whing of a
bullet, or a concerted rush upon the rear-guard from some
conveniently narrow ravine.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>
<p>Little interruptions of this sort helped to keep all ranks
on the alert, and to make things cheerful generally; but
they also took up time. And although the middle of March
found them back within twenty-one miles of Kohat, there
seemed little hope of quieting the country under another
week or two at least.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 16th, after two days of skirmishing
and a broken night under the stars, imperative need of water
compelled them to encamp at the open end of a valley whose
enclosing heights narrowed abruptly to the northward into an
ugly-looking gorge.</p>

<p>Tents sprang up right and left; lines for horses and mules
established themselves in less time than it would take the
uninitiated to see where and how the thing could be done;
and that eighth wonder of the world, the native cook,
achieved a four-course dinner with a mud oven, army rations,
a small supply of looted fowls, and a large supply of
ingenuity. A party of cavalry, having reconnoitred the
ravines branching off into higher hills, reported no signs
of the enemy. A cordon of sentries was told off for duty;
and the posting of strong pickets on the near hill-tops, and
in the neighbourhood of the camp itself, completed the
night's arrangements. Clanking of accoutrements, jangle of
harness, and all the subdued hum of human life, died away
into stillness; lights dropped out one by one; and the
valley was given over to silence and a multitude of stars.</p>

<p>Touched into silver here and there by the ethereal
radiance&mdash;for starshine is a reality in India&mdash;the scene
presented a Dantesque mingling of beauty and terror,&mdash;the
twin elements of life, which are "only one, not two."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>
<p>At a little distance behind the clustering tents the ground
sloped boldly upward to summits dark with patches of stunted
forest; and beyond these again the snow-peaks of the Safed
Koh mountains stood dreaming to the stars. Lower down, at
rare intervals, dwarf oaks and the "low lean thorn" of the
desert stood out, black and spectral, against the lesser
darkness of rocks and stones. In the valley itself the
stones had it all their own way;&mdash;a ghostly company, rounded
and polished by the stream, which crept among them now a
mere ribbon of silver, but in four months' time would come
thundering through the gorge in a garment of foam, with the
shout of a wild thing loosed from bondage. The triumph of
desolation was reached in the savage peaks that almost
fronted the camp and descended to the valley in a cataract
of crags. Here even the persevering thorn-bush could take no
hold upon a surface of bare rock, split up into clefts, and
chiselled to such fantastic shapes that the whole might have
inspired Dante's conception of the ravine by which he
descended to the nether hell.</p>

<p>Absorbed in the requirements of earth, and untroubled by
ghostly imaginings, officers and men slept soundly, with one
eye open, as soldiers experienced in Frontier warfare learn
to do; and when at last the earth, turning in its sleep,
swung round towards the sun and the still air quivered with
foreknowledge of morning, a sudden outcropping of life,
where no life should be, amply justified the need for
vigilance.</p>

<p>From the darkness of a ravine some distance above the camp,
a shadowy mass of figures poured hurriedly, stealthily, into
the valley&mdash;men of splendid physique, in loose dark
draperies or sheepskin coats, carrying leathern shields and
the formidable Afridi knife, bone-handled, with a two-foot
blade that will halve a man's head as if it were a lemon.</p>

<p>By a preconcerted arrangement they divided into two parties,
and keeping within the deepest patches of shadow, bore down
upon the nearest pickets with a fierce, soundless rush,&mdash;the
most disconcerting form of attack to sleepy sentries in the
small hours, when life and courage are at their lowest ebb.
But the picket sentries happened to be Sikhs; and they are
ill men to tackle at close quarters or to spring on
unawares.</p>

<p>Close upon the first determined rush came a scuffle, a
smothered shout, the sharp crack of rifles in quick
succession; and before the hills had flung back the volley
of sound, the whole camp hummed with life from end to end,
like a broken ant-heap.</p>

<p>A fusilade of shots rang out on all sides. Men hurried about
among the tents, concentrating at the two points of attack.
Here and there, amid the puffs of smoke that rose and
vanished in the blue, a lifted sword or sabre gleamed like a
flash of light.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>
<p>A number of Afridis forced their way into the camp, lunging
at every tent-rope within reach of their long knives, and in
the dim light it was not easy to distinguish friend from
foe. But the first sharp shock of encounter past, it became
evident that the troops were getting the best of the affair;
and the Afridis, whose valour is not always tempered with
discretion, saw fit to beat a rapid retreat up the valley,
hoping to reach the ravine before the cavalry started in
pursuit.</p>

<p>The men in camp, meanwhile, had leisure to breathe freely,
after their rough awakening; to look about and recognise one
another, and exchange cheerful congratulations on the
resolute stand made by the Sikhs.</p>

<p>"That you, Desmond?"</p>

<p>The Colonel's voice greeted Desmond as he emerged from his
tent where his servant had been pressing on him a half-cold
cup of cocoa; and the two men faced each other, bareheaded,
in shirt and breeches, unmistakable stains upon their naked
blades.</p>

<p>"The Ressaldar's falling in your squadron," Buchanan said
briskly. "Lose no time, and follow 'em up like hell. They'll
break away into the hills, of course. But the chances are
they'll concentrate again in the gorge and try to catch the
main body as it passes through. So if they give you the slip
now, ride straight on and secure the defile for us. I'll
send out a detachment of infantry at the double to crown the
heights; and I can safely leave all minor details to your
discretion."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir." And Desmond departed to carry out his
orders with high elation at his heart.</p>

<p>There is no compliment a soldier appreciates more keenly
than one which takes the practical form of leaving details
to his own discretion; and, coming from Buchanan, it was
doubly acceptable. For, in Desmond's opinion, there were few
men in the world like the Colonel, hard and uncommunicative
as he was; and it never occurred to him that his strong,
unspoken admiration was returned with interest by the
reserve-ridden Scot.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>
<p>During the next fifteen minutes he fully justified his
sobriquet of "<i>Bijli-wallah</i> Sahib." Before the Afridis were
out of sight a hundred and sixty sabres, headed by himself
and Denvil, dashed along the rugged pathway in gallant
style, the men leaning well forward, and urging their horses
to break-neck speed. But the enemy were well ahead from the
start, and in any case, they had the advantage on their own
rough soil. The squadron overtook them&mdash;breathless and
eager&mdash;just as the final stragglers plunged into a lateral
cleft, which would hold the darkness for another half-hour
at least.</p>

<p>Further pursuit was out of the question; and, by way of
consolation, the foremost sowars were ordered to dismount
and open rapid fire in the direction of the fugitives.
Groans, curses, and the thud of falling bodies testified to
its effect; and with laconic murmurs of satisfaction the men
remounted, and rode on up the rapidly narrowing gorge.</p>

<p>By now, along the silver snows to eastward, the great change
had begun. The sky was blue above them; and the last of the
stars had melted in the onrushing tide of light, which had
already awakened the sandstone peaks to the warm hue of
life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>
<p>The party mounted the ascent at a foot's pace to ease their
horses; and Desmond's eyes and mind, being as it were "off
duty," turned thoughtfully upon the Boy who rode at his
side, a very incarnation of good health and good spirits. It
seemed that the outcome of his critical inspection was
approval, for it ended in a nod that confirmed some pleasant
inward assurance. During the past few weeks Denvil had
proved himself thoroughly "up to the mark";&mdash;hot-headed but
reliable; square and upright in mind as in body; a fine
soldier in the making. He had not yet arrived at the older
man's keen mental interest in his profession; but closer
intimacy with Desmond had kindled in him an answering spark
of that idealism, that unswerving subordination of self to
duty which justifies and ennobles the great game of war. He
coveted action, risk, responsibility&mdash;three things which the
Staff Corps subaltern, especially on the Frontier, tastes
earlier than most men; and which go far to make him one of
the straightest specimens of manhood in the world. In
Denvil's eyes the whole expedition was one tremendous spree,
which he was enjoying to the top of his bent; and Desmond,
remembering the good years of his own apprenticeship, could
gauge the measure of that enjoyment to the full. He felt
justified in expecting great things of the Boy, and decided
to work him hard all through the hot weather;&mdash;in his eyes
the highest compliment a man could pay to a promising
junior.</p>

<p>"By the way, Harry," he said suddenly, as the defile,
deep-sunken between towering rock, loomed darkly into view,
"I've got a word of encouragement for you before we part
company. You did an uncommonly gallant bit of work in that
skirmish yesterday. The Colonel spoke of it; and
congratulated me on having the smartest subaltern in the
regiment. Of course I've known it myself this long while;
and I don't think it will hurt you to know it too."</p>

<p>Denvil flushed hotly through his tan.</p>

<p>"I should be rather a poor sort of chap if I didn't manage
to do pretty well&mdash;under you," he said, with awkward
bluntness, looking straight between his charger's ears.</p>

<p>Desmond laughed. "Very neatly turned off, old chap. Now, I'm
bound to call a halt till the Sikhs come up with us. Hope to
goodness they'll be quick about it. Confounded nuisance
having to wait."</p>

<p>Both men reined in their horses, and their consuming
impatience. The squadron followed suit; and in an amazingly
short time the Sikhs came into view, toiling lustily up the
incline at their utmost speed.</p>

<p>Desmond turned in his saddle and raked the hillsides with
his field-glasses.</p>

<p>"Looks empty enough, in all conscience," he remarked.</p>

<p>The words were hardly spoken when a single shot startled the
echoes of the rocks, and instant alertness passed like an
electric current through the squadron. The advance guard,
which had already entered the defile, consisted of three
promising young Pathans from Denvil's troop; and anxiety for
the fate of his favourites pricked the Boy to keener
impatience.</p>

<p>"I say, Desmond," he urged, "can't I take twenty men and
push on to find out what's up. They'll be taking pot-shots
at my men, unless I put a stop to it. For God's sake, let me
go."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>
<p>Desmond could not repress an approving smile at an
impetuosity that matched his own. He glanced down the valley
at the advancing Sikhs, and saw that he would not be long
delayed in following on. Moreover, he shared the Boy's
anxiety for his three picked men; and a shot fired, being
tantamount to a declaration of hostilities, justified
immediate advance to the scene of action.</p>

<p>"Go ahead then," he said. "Advance warily; and good luck to
you."</p>

<p>The Boy needed no second bidding. Eagerly, yet with all due
precautions, he went forward with his handful of Pathans;
and was soon lost to sight and sound in the darkness of the
giant cleft.</p>

<p>Desmond, left alone, could hardly contain himself till the
infantry came up. Dividing into two flanking parties, they
scrambled up the steep slopes into the full radiance of
dawn; while Desmond, with his squadron ready drawn up,
awaited the signal, "All's clear," before entering the
defile.</p>

<p>In due time it came; and they moved on between the frowning
cliffs at a pace as rapid as the exigencies of the situation
would permit.</p>

<p>Here night fronted them, dank and chill. It was as if the
clock had been put back four hours. Only a jagged strip of
sky, between projecting crags, announced the advent of day.
No living thing seemed to inhabit this region of perpetual
twilight. At intervals a gnarled and twisted bush grew out
of a cleft, lifting spectral foliage toward where the sun
should be, and was not. Silence pervaded the dusk like a
living presence; unseen, but so poignantly felt that the
whisper of the stream and the crunch of shingle under the
horses' hoofs seemed an affront to the ghostly spirit of the
place; and the sowars, when exchanging remarks among
themselves, instinctively refrained from raising their
voices.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>
<p>Desmond, closely followed by his trumpeter, rode ahead of
the troopers, chafing at their leaden-footed progress. A
hand-gallop would have been too slow for the speed of his
thoughts, tormented as he was by anxious wondering what had
become of the Boy; while his ears were strained to catch the
first sounds of contest from the heights, which were already
widening out a little, and beginning to slope towards lower
ground.</p>

<p>Sounds came at length&mdash;harsh and startling;&mdash;the
unmistakable note of the jezail; answering shots from his
own men;&mdash;proofs incontestable that a sharp engagement was
in progress up above.</p>

<p>"Ambuscaded,&mdash;by Heaven!" was Desmond's instant thought.
Mercifully the exit was already in sight; and flinging brisk
instructions to the Ressaldar to follow him closely with a
hundred sowars, leaving the remainder to take charge of the
horses, and hold the opening till further orders, Desmond
made for it full tilt, spurring Badshah Pasand as he had
never been spurred in all his days. On dashing out into the
sunlight he was greeted by a rattle of musketry from behind
a tumbled mass of rock; and a dozen bullets buzzed about him
like bees.</p>

<p>One riddled his helmet, stirring his hair as it passed. A
second struck his left shoulder, inflicting a flesh wound of
which he was not even conscious at the moment; for Badshah
Pasand lunged ominously forward; swayed, staggered; and with
a sound between a cough and a groan, fell headlong, flinging
his rider clear on to the rough upward slope.</p>

<p>Luckily for him, Desmond pitched on to his sound shoulder;
and though bruised and shaken, was none the worse for his
fall. The foremost of his men dismounted and opened fire
upon the treacherous rock, without eliciting response; and
quick as lightning he sprang to his feet, mad with rage and
pain. A single glance showed him that his charger's wounds
were mortal. Two well-directed bullets had entered the
chest; and the great soft eyes were glazing fast.</p>

<p>With a swift contraction of the heart, Desmond turned away,
and issued hurried orders for a hundred men to dismount and
take the hill at full speed. Half a dozen of Denvil's
Pathans&mdash;left in charge of the discarded horses&mdash;gave
information that the Sahib had taken his sowars up some time
before, commanding them to await his return.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>
<p>Distracted by anxiety, Desmond awaited the dismounting of
his troopers, revolver in hand. The instant they were ready
he bounded over the broken ground, his trumpeter dogging him
like a shadow, and a self-imposed bodyguard of six sowars
following close upon his heel. Behind these again the
mountain-side was alive with clambering men; and the small
party left below enviously watched their ascent.</p>

<p>Only by the impetus of his spirit did Desmond manage to keep
ahead of his men; for in general the native outstrips the
Englishman in this form of mountaineering. One thought
hammering at his brain goaded him to superhuman exertion:
"Those devils shall not murder Harry before I reach him."</p>

<p>Breathless and resolute, he hurried on, stumbling now and
again from sheer excess of haste, clenching his teeth to
keep the curses back. A dull stain spread slowly across his
left shoulder, where the blood was soaking through his khaki
coat.</p>

<p>The slope ended in a twenty-foot wall of rocks, massed so as
to form huge irregular steps, that led to an abrupt bit of
level, whereon the fighting appeared to be taking place.
Sounds came to him now that lashed him to a frenzy; the
clash of knives and sabres, the thud of many feet; the
fierce shouts without which it is impossible for primitive
man to slay or be slain.</p>

<p>Desmond never quite knew how he climbed those formidable
steps; and as he vaulted up the last of them, the whole
dread scene sprang abruptly into view.</p>

<p>Denvil and his fifteen Pathans had been ambuscaded and
outnumbered; and in the cramped space a sharp hand-to-hand
encounter was in progress. A small party of Sikhs had
already come up with him; but even so the odds were heavily
on the wrong side. It was simply a case of "dying game";&mdash;of
adding one more to the list of "regrettable incidents" which
figure too frequently in the record of Border warfare.</p>

<p>A new risen sun smiled serenely down upon it all; and the
awakened earth was frankly indifferent to the issue.</p>

<p>But amid the stirring confusion of a struggle at close
quarters Desmond saw one thing only; and the sight struck at
his heart like a sword-thrust.</p>

<p>Harry Denvil, hard pressed by four Afridis brandishing long
knives and leathern shields, stood with his back against a
rock, fighting for dear life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>
<p>Five of his men and several of the enemy lay dead or
wounded around him. His left arm was disabled; his helmet
gone; his hair gleaming red-gold in the sunlight; his young
face, white and desperate, disfigured by an ugly cut across
the forehead and cheek-bone, from which the blood trickled
unheeded in a sluggish stream.</p>

<p>He had flung away his empty revolver; and was warding off
blows right and left, using his sword with a coolness and
dexterity which would have surprised him had he been aware
of it. But he was aware of nothing except a fierce desire
not to die yet&mdash;not yet; and to get a straight cut at one of
the dark faces that pressed in upon him with such pitiless
persistence.</p>

<p>At sight of Desmond a great cry broke from him.</p>

<p>"Desmond!" he shouted; "Desmond&mdash;thank God!"</p>

<p>For answer Desmond ran blindly forward, sheer lust of
slaughter in his heart; trumpeter, bodyguard, and the
foremost troopers following as closely as their captain's
ardour would permit.</p>

<p>But an unreasoning sense of safety put Harry momentarily off
his guard. He took a hasty step away from the rock, making
it possible for the first time to strike at him from behind:
and, in the same instant, Desmond fired. Before his bullet
could reach its destination, the long knife had descended,
swift and certain. And even as the man who wielded it
dropped like a log, Harry Denvil stumbled forward; and, with
a thick sob, fell face downward at Desmond's feet.</p>

<p>There was no time to stoop and ascertain whether the knife
had completed its work. Striding across his subaltern's
body, Desmond turned upon his assailants, all the natural
savage in him lashed to a white heat of fury, and fired
twice in quick succession, with deadly effect. But the knife
of a third man bit into his flesh like fire, inflicting deep
gashes on the left arm and hand, while another slipped
behind him, his uplifted blade glinting in the sunlight.</p>

<p>By this time Rajinder Singh was behind him also; and like a
lightning-streak, his tulwar whizzed through the air,
cleaving the man's head from his body at a blow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>
<p>Desmond swung sharply round to find his reinforcements
swarming over the plateau's edge.</p>

<p>"Well struck, Sirdar Sahib!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the sentence was never finished. A puff of smoke from
behind a distant rock, the boom of a jezail, and Desmond
fell beside the Boy, stunned by a well-aimed shot on the
edge of the cheek-bone, the slug glancing off perilously
close to the right eye.</p>

<p>A shout of rage went up from his men. "The Captain
Sahib,&mdash;the Captain Sahib!" But Rajinder Singh promptly
assuming command, bade them turn upon the Afridi devils and
smite their souls to hell; and, forming a protective ring
about their fallen officers, they obeyed with right
goodwill.</p>

<p>The arrival of supports, however, made it clear to the enemy
that they themselves were now heavily outnumbered; and after
a desultory resistance they broke up and fled, the sowars
zealously speeding their departure.</p>

<p>The whole incident had passed in an incredibly short space
of time; and now, with a low cry, Rajinder Singh sank on his
knees beside Desmond, cold fear at his heart, his lean
fingers trembling as they pushed up the watch-strap and
pressed the smooth tanned wrist.</p>

<p>"He lives!&mdash;<i>Parmeshwar</i><a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> be praised;&mdash;the Captain Sahib
lives!" the old man murmured ecstatically, shaking his head
at the same time over the wound in the cheek-bone, which had
an ugly look.</p>

<p>In Denvil's wrist no flutter of life was left. The Boy's
soul had passed unstained to its account; and the
Ressaldar's stern eyes softened as they rested on the
bright, blood-stained hair.</p>

<p>Very gently, as though Denvil were merely asleep, he turned
him over and closed the unseeing eyes. No shadow of pain
marred the repose of the lips. They looked as if they had
just left off smiling and meant very soon to smile again.</p>

<p>The Ressaldar sighed, and shook his head thoughtfully once
again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>
<p>"Doubtless it was written, ... it was the will of God," he
decided, with the pious stoicism of the East; and thereupon
issued immediate orders to his signallers to open up
communication with the main body of troops in the valley,
enumerating casualties, and adding an urgent request for an
ambulance party to be pushed forward at the utmost speed.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A short stab of pain jerked Desmond back to consciousness
with a curse upon his lips. He found himself lying in a
hospital doolie set in the shade on a slab of rock. Both
flaps had been flung up, and James Mackay stood beside him,
investigating the wound in his face with conscientious
thoroughness. It was not a pleasant proceeding. Hence
Desmond's protest, which brought a twinkle of satisfaction
to the doctor's eyes.</p>

<p>"Curse away, old man. It's a treat to hear you," he said
heartily, "Just take a drop of this now, to keep you all
there," and he held a glass of brandy and water to Desmond's
lips. "They've given you a nasty wound here. Wants looking
to at once. I'm going to hurt you like hell, I know; but you
must put up with it. Swear at me as much as you please, if
it eases you at all."</p>

<p>He probed a peculiarly tender spot as he spoke. Desmond
clenched his teeth and "put up with it" in silence. Free
permission to swear had quenched the desire&mdash;a common trick
of human perversity; and just as he began to feel that one
minute more of it would stretch endurance to
breaking-point&mdash;the thing was done. A sloping bandage
encircled his head, eclipsing his right eye; and he
discovered that the Colonel was standing by the doolie,
tugging at his grey moustache&mdash;sure sign of mental
disturbance&mdash;and listening attentively to the wiry little
doctor, who spoke in an urgent undertone.</p>

<p>He turned when Mackay left off speaking.</p>

<p>"Bad business this, Desmond," he said laconically. "Thank
God it was no worse, though."</p>

<p>And Desmond had but two words for answer, sharp and anxious.</p>

<p>"The Boy?"</p>

<p>"We've lost Denvil," Buchanan growled between his teeth.
"And we could very ill spare him."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>
<p>Desmond closed his eyes and drew a deep breath. Speech was
beyond him. His mind, dizzy with pain and loss of blood,
refused to grasp the truth. Two hours ago the Boy had been
radiantly, vigorously alive. It was rank foolishness to
expect a man to believe that he would never hear him speak
or laugh again.</p>

<p>He was roused by Buchanan's hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"Look here, Desmond," he said, "we must be moving again now.
I merely came to see how things were going with you before
pushing on."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Colonel. I'm in the rear for the present, I
suppose?" And he tried to smile.</p>

<p>"Not exactly. As we are within two days' march of the
station and there's little left to do but sweep up the
rubbish, I have told off a strong escort to return to Kohat
with the wounded men,&mdash;Denvil, and yourself. You've been
badly knocked about, and you need careful seeing to at
once."</p>

<p>"Won't you leave me out of the programme, sir? You know I'm
hard as nails; I'm sure I could manage to hang on to the
saddle, and be fit for light duty in a few days' time. Give
me the chance, anyway. I'll do my level best."</p>

<p>"Never knew you do anything else," Buchanan answered
gruffly.</p>

<p>Then there was a short silence. Hard as he was, the man
rebelled against the thing he had to say; and Desmond's
unconquerable spirit put him in no better humour for his
task.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," he began, "I'm no hand at beating about
the bush; I can only tell you straight that for the present
you must give up all hope of getting back to duty, light or
otherwise. Mackay is not satisfied about that wound in your
face. The slug went too close to the eye, and may
possibly&mdash;have injured the nerve."</p>

<p>Desmond started and clenched his hand.</p>

<p>"Good God, Colonel!" he broke out hoarsely. "D'you
mean&mdash;blindness?"</p>

<p>The ring of open fear in a brave man's voice is not a
pleasant thing to hear. Buchanan felt he had been too blunt,
and regretted not having allowed Mackay to speak.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>
<p>"Don't jump to hasty conclusions, man," he said quickly.
"We have to recognise the possibility in order to prevent
it,&mdash;that's all. Mackay returns with you. He'll get a second
opinion, if necessary; and we've signalled the news to
Wyndham in full. All you've got to do now is to knock under
like a man, and give your eyes every possible chance; even
if it means lying in the dark for a week or two; you
understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I understand."</p>

<p>There was bitterness in the studied resignation of his tone.</p>

<p>Colonel Buchanan put out his hand and kept firm hold of
Desmond's arm while he spoke.</p>

<p>"You'll be reasonable then, and&mdash;obey orders? You ought to
find the coast clear going back and have no trouble. Young
Spence commands the party, and Rajinder Singh takes thirty
of your men. The old chap begged for permission to accompany
you. See you again in a fortnight, if not sooner. Keep up a
good heart; and take every possible precaution, for your own
sake and&mdash;for the sake of the Regiment."</p>

<p>The final injunctions, jerked out brusquely, were in the
nature of an achievement for this man of few words; and
Desmond knew it. He wrung the iron-hard hand that held his
own with all the force still left in him; and Colonel
Buchanan returned to his waiting charger.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>
<p>That afternoon, under a brilliant sky, the little ambulance
party set out for Kohat&mdash;thirty cavalry and twenty infantry,
with six swaying doolies in their midst. And among all the
occupants of those comfortless conveyances, Harry Denvil was
the only one for whom that journey was not a prolonged
torment of pain and unrest.</p>

<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the morning of that eventful 17th of March, Evelyn and
Honor left the bungalow directly after breakfast, bent upon
such shopping as Kohat could afford.</p>

<p>The nearest approach to shops, in the accepted sense of the
word, were the open stalls in the native city. But there
could be no question of exploring these; and the manifold
needs of Western womanhood were inadequately met by the
regimental go-downs attached to each corps in the
cantonment. These consisted of spacious buildings, shelved
from floor to ceiling, and stocked with a fine medley of
human requirements, ranging from bone buttons to champagne,
from quinine and chlorodyne to rolls of silk for evening
gowns. A new consignment from "down-country" came up every
month or so; and it was quite one of the events of life in
Kohat to go the round of the go-downs as soon as possible
after the arrival of these, so as to secure the pick of the
market while the goods were fresh and the choice
comparatively varied. Herein lay ample scope for those small
spites and jealousies that are more than bread and meat to
women of a certain type.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>
<p>Evelyn had actually sent for gloves and shoes by this
means, from a cheap Calcutta firm, instead of despatching an
order to Simla regally regardless of cost. They by no means
satisfied her fastidious taste; but she felt exalted to a
superhuman pitch of virtue as she bore them home in her
dandy.</p>

<p>"I don't believe Theo will like these shoes one bit!" she
remarked with a satisfied laugh to Honor who rode beside
her. "He will tell me to order the next ones from Simla
straight away, and I shall be ever so dutiful and obey him
without any fuss&mdash;shan't I, you grave, wise Honor?"</p>

<p>"I should be an inhuman monster if I could keep grave and
wise in your company!" Honor answered, laughing back at her.
"You will go on buying expensive shoes to the end of the
chapter, if that's what you are driving at. Why have your
spirits gone up with such a run this morning?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It's nice enough that they <i>are</i> up. I got a
lovely letter from Theo&mdash;that's partly why, perhaps." Her
eyes softened at the remembrance of that letter. "He'll be
home again in less than a fortnight."</p>

<p>"Yes; in less than a fortnight," Honor repeated, and
wondered where she should go when that time arrived. She had
not yet found courage to face the idea in detail.</p>

<p>Evelyn kept up an unbroken ripple of hilarity till the
verandah was reached, laughing as Honor had not heard her
laugh since Theo had left.</p>

<p>"You're 'fey,' child," she said, as she helped her out of
the dandy. "I shall have you in floods of tears before
night."</p>

<p>"No, you won't; I don't feel as if anything <i>could</i> happen
to make me cry to-day. Hullo! there's Major Wyndham's horse
out there."</p>

<p>Honor started.</p>

<p>"What can he want over here so early? Come in quick and find
out."</p>

<p>They hurried through the hall into the dining-room, Evelyn
leading, a swift premonition of evil killing the laughter on
their lips.</p>

<p>Paul stood by the piano looking at Desmond's photograph; his
arms folded; his "February face" more eloquent than he knew.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mrs Desmond," he said; and his sympathetic
hand-clasp sent her mercurial spirits down to zero.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>
<p>"What is it?" she asked, blanching visibly. "You have
brought bad news?"</p>

<p>Paul assented in silence.</p>

<p>"If it is very horrible&mdash;don't tell me&mdash;I won't hear it!"
She held up both hands, as if warding off a blow. But Honor,
coming quickly forward, put both arms round her.</p>

<p>"Hush, dear, hush!" she said soothingly. "That is nonsense.
We <i>must</i> know what has happened, at once."</p>

<p>"Let him tell <i>you</i>, then; it won't hurt you like it hurts
me." And disengaging herself, she went over to the verandah
doorway, and stood there, looking out into the sunshine; her
back to the room; her small hands clasped; every nerve
strained to miss no word of what was passing behind her.</p>

<p>Honor turned promptly on Paul, an anguish of suspense in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;the worst?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;not that," he reassured her hastily.</p>

<p>"Tell me everything, please."</p>

<p>"I only know bare facts; the news came by helio. It seems
there was a sharp hand-to-hand engagement. The Boy and some
of his men were taken by surprise. Just as Theo reached them
Denvil was&mdash;killed!"</p>

<p>A stifled sound broke from Evelyn.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;Theo?" Honor's low voice seemed to come from very far
away.</p>

<p>"Theo has been badly cut about. Four wounds. The most
serious is a bullet wound in his face&mdash;close to the right
eye. They seem afraid that he may possibly&mdash;lose his sight."</p>

<p>"It is not true&mdash;oh, it is <i>not</i> true!" Evelyn's hands went
up to her head with a desperate cry. Then she swayed,
tottered backward, and fell prone among the sofa cushions.</p>

<p>"Honor&mdash;come to me&mdash;I'm frightened!" she moaned, without
lifting her head; and in an instant Honor was bending over
her, murmuring brave words of encouragement, removing her
hat, and mechanically smoothing her hair.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;he still here?" Evelyn asked under her breath.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. Do you want him?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>
<p>"No&mdash;no; send him away. I want you&mdash;only you!"</p>

<p>Wyndham was already nearing the door and Honor followed him
out into the hall.</p>

<p>"You see she's a little off her balance, poor child."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see," he answered wearily. "And I thank God with all
my heart that <i>you</i> are here. Will you tell Mrs Desmond that
an escort is returning to-day with Theo and&mdash;the Boy. They
will reach Kohat to-morrow evening."</p>

<p>Honor straightened herself suddenly.</p>

<p>"I will tell her. To-morrow evening. Does Frank know too?"</p>

<p>"Yes; she was in when I came. It upset her very much. Not a
soul in the regiment&mdash;officers or men&mdash;will have a minute's
peace of mind till the result of this wound is known for
certain. In all the misery of it, one is proud to realise
that."</p>

<p>Something of his own grief showed in his voice for the first
time, and Honor's heart contracted with too keen a sympathy.</p>

<p>"Ah, Paul! you speak of it so calmly&mdash;as if you were just
one with the rest. But I, at least, can guess what the pain
and suspense must be for you."</p>

<p>His face softened at the tender inflection of her voice.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "even you cannot guess that. Now go back to
his wife. If I can be of any use at all send for me. I shall
not come round otherwise till I bring him here to-morrow
evening. I mean to ride out with a small escort and meet
them on the way."</p>

<p>Honor found Evelyn rigid and tearless among her cushions.
The strange mingling of coldness and terror in her eyes
startled the girl. She hurried to the sofa and knelt down at
her side.</p>

<p>"Don't look like that, Evelyn," she said. "It's horrible!
Only think, Theo will be here to-morrow evening. Paul told
me so just now."</p>

<p>"To-morrow&mdash;to-morrow? He will be here, in this
house&mdash;to-morrow?" She repeated the word with stunned
iteration, and there was no feeling in her tone, only an
uncanny fear, that chilled the blood in Honor's veins.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>
<p>"I never thought&mdash;it would be so soon. How can we manage
about getting away?"</p>

<p>"Getting away&mdash;where&mdash;in Heaven's name?" Honor rose
abruptly. She began to feel as though she were moving in a
nightmare.</p>

<p>"Oh, anywhere, away from here. I can't&mdash;I won't see him,
when he is 'badly cut about' and&mdash;half blind. I thought&mdash;if
you would take me to Murree&mdash;Mrs Olliver would be quite glad
to look after him. And when he is better, he could come up
too. But if&mdash;if he is really going to be&mdash;blind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She closed her eyes and shuddered. No flicker of pity
stirred in Honor's heart. It needed all her force of will to
control her temper, even for a few minutes longer. But a
grim curiosity urged her to discover how far it was possible
to travel along such incredible lines of thought and
feeling.</p>

<p>"Well, what then?" she demanded coldly.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;I know I could&mdash;never come back to him&mdash;never!"
Theo's wife answered slowly, without raising her eyes, or
the look in Honor's face would surely have frozen the words
on her lips. "To feel that he was always in the dark would
frighten me out of my life. And he would never be left
alone, I know. There are so many&mdash;others."</p>

<p>But Honor could bear no more. Bending down, she caught hold
of Evelyn's shoulders and fairly shook her, as though she
would shake her back to life and human feeling. Her blue
eyes blazed with indignation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>
<p>"How <i>dare</i> you talk like that!" she said in a low note of
concentrated wrath. "How dare you think such despicable
thoughts! Of course there are others who would give their
lives to save him from a minute's pain; and you would let
them take your place,&mdash;yours? And you can actually expect
that <i>I</i>&mdash;of all people&mdash;will back you up in your desertion
of him? No indeed! If you go, you go alone; and I shall
never have a word to say to you again. I may be speaking
hotly, because I am furiously angry. But I mean every word I
say; and my actions will prove it. What's more, <i>I will not
let you go</i>. You <i>shall</i> stand by him, however frightened
you may be. You talk of&mdash;loving him, and you would treat him
as I should be ashamed to treat a dog! Evelyn! Evelyn!"&mdash;her
voice broke suddenly, and tears started to her eyes,&mdash;"tell
me you did not mean what you said; or I don't know how I am
to go on helping you at all!"</p>

<p>There was more of command than of entreaty in the last
words, and Evelyn looked up at the transfigured beauty of
her face with a slow shivering sigh.</p>

<p>"You are very wonderful, and very&mdash;terrible, Honor," she
said. "I never imagined you could be as terrible as that."
Then her lips quivered, and she caught at the girl's skirt,
drawing her nearer. "You <i>must</i> go on helping me, or
everything will go to pieces."</p>

<p>"So long as you remain a loyal wife to&mdash;Theo, I cannot
choose but do so, with all my heart."</p>

<p>She knelt down again now; and Evelyn, flinging both arms
round her neck, broke into a passion of weeping.</p>

<p>"I think I was half mad," she moaned through her tears,
clinging to Honor as a drowning woman clings to a spar. "And
I am dreadfully frightened still. But I will do whatever you
tell me. I will try to be a loyal wife, even if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We won't think of that at all," Honor interposed hastily.
"It cannot&mdash;it shall not happen!"</p>

<p>But Evelyn's tears flowed on unchecked. The fire of Honor's
just anger had melted the morsel of ice in her heart; and in
a very short time she had cried herself to sleep.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>
<p>Then Honor gently unlocked the clinging fingers, and went
straight to Frank Olliver's room.</p>

<h4>I WANT LADYBIRD.</h4>

<div class="blockpoem">
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">"So free we seem; so fettered fast we are."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 22em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Browning.</span></span><br />
<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A low</span> sun was gilding the hill-tops when two doolies, borne
by sturdy <i>kahars</i> and escorted by Wyndham and Mackay,
passed between the gate-posts of Desmond's bungalow. Honor
stood with Evelyn at the head of the verandah steps; but as
the <i>kahars</i> halted, and the officers prepared to dismount,
she moved back a space, leaving her to welcome her husband
alone.</p>

<p>The blood ebbed from Evelyn's face as she watched Theo mount
the steps, slowly, uncertainly, supported on either side by
Wyndham and the doctor&mdash;he who, in normal circumstances,
would have cleared them at a bound and taken her in his
arms. His appearance alone struck terror into her heart. Was
this the splendid-looking husband who had ridden away full
of life and energy,&mdash;this strange seeming man, whose face
was disfigured and more than half-hidden by an unsightly
bandage and a broad green shade; whose empty coat-sleeve,
slashed and blood-stained, suggested too vividly the
condition of the arm strapped into place beneath?</p>

<p>It was all she could do not to shrink back instinctively
when the men moved aside, as Honor had done, to afford
husband and wife some small measure of privacy, and Theo
held out his hand.</p>

<p>"They've sent me back rather the worse for wear, Ladybird,"
he said, with a smile; "but Mackay will put the pieces
together in good time."</p>

<p>"Oh, Theo&mdash;I hope so!&mdash;It's dreadful to see you&mdash;like that."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>
<p>The hand she surrendered to him was cold as ice; and the
attempt at welcome in her voice was checked by a paralysing
fear and constraint. Thirty-six hours of severe pain in body
and mind had failed to break his spirit; but the thing was
achieved by a dozen words from his wife. He knew now what to
expect from her; and for the moment he was stricken
speechless.</p>

<p>"I am so&mdash;sorry," she murmured, "about&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes, I know," he took her up quickly; and there was an
awkward silence.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;what&mdash;is in that other doolie?" she asked, in a
hurried whisper.</p>

<p>"The Boy."</p>

<p>"But, Theo&mdash;you're not going to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For God's sake shut up!"</p>

<p>He swayed a little in speaking, and promptly Paul was at his
side. No one had heard what passed; and when Mackay,
returning to his post by the wounded arm, gently urged
Desmond forward, Paul signalled to Evelyn to take his place,
while he went back to the doolie.</p>

<p>"Just a minute, Mrs Desmond," he said in a low tone.</p>

<p>Evelyn, startled by the request, stood irresolute; and since
there was no time for hesitancy, Honor came forward and put
her hand under Theo's elbow. She felt a jar go all through
him at her touch, and knew that he had heard Wyndham's
request.</p>

<p>"Ah, Honor," he said, by way of greeting, "I'm afraid I've
come back a mere log on your hands."</p>

<p>An undernote of bitterness in his tone gave her courage to
speak the thought in her mind. "We are only too thankful to
have got you back safe&mdash;in any condition," she murmured.</p>

<p>He did not answer at once; and she moved away to make place
for Paul, whose face was set in very rigid lines.</p>

<p>"Take me to the <i>duftur</i>," Desmond commanded curtly. "I'll
not be put to bed."</p>

<p>"No, no, man; we'll settle you up in your long chair,"
Mackay answered soothingly. He perceived that by some means
Mrs Desmond had jarred his patient, and was in high
ill-humour with her accordingly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>
<p>At the study door, Amar Singh almost laid his head at
Desmond's feet. Within the room they found Frank Olliver
arranging pillows and a rug on the deck-chair, and on a
table beside it a light meal awaited him.</p>

<p>The meal ended, they all left him with one accord,
instinctively making way for his wife&mdash;who was crying her
heart out in the next room.</p>

<p>Paul was the last to leave. He remained standing by Desmond,
resting a hand on his sound shoulder. But there are silences
more illuminating than speech; and Theo Desmond knew all
that was in his friend's heart at that moment&mdash;all that
could never be spoken between them, because they were
Englishmen, born into a heritage of incurable reserve.</p>

<p>"You're going to pull through this," Paul said quietly.</p>

<p>"Am I? Ask Mackay."</p>

<p>"No need for that&mdash;I'm sure of it; and&mdash;in the mean
while&mdash;&mdash;" A tightening of his grasp supplied the rest.</p>

<p>"Thanks, old man. I know what you mean."</p>

<p>Then Paul went reluctantly out, and on into the
drawing-room, where he found Mackay and Honor Meredith in
close conference. The little doctor was laying down the law
in respect of his patient with characteristic bluntness.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Meredith," he had said, as he met her in the
hall, and drew her aside into the empty room, "I'm a plain
man, and you must put up with plain speaking for the next
few minutes. It's no light matter to be responsible for a
chap like Desmond. Not a morsel of use talking to his wife!
She seems to have upset him already. The Lord alone knows
how women do these things. Fools men are to care! But
Desmond is what you call finely organised; and you can't
handle a violin as you would a big drum. Frankly, now, his
eyesight's in danger; and that wound in his cheek is an ugly
one in any case. He wants careful nursing, and I refuse to
put him into Mrs Desmond's hands. I'd deserve hanging for
murder if I did! Remains Mrs Olliver, or yourself. 'Twould
be awkward for Mrs Olliver to take his wife's place when
there is a capable woman on the spot. So now, will you take
charge of Desmond for me, and put yourself under my
orders?&mdash;that's the real <i>mutlub</i><a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> of the whole matter.
You're welcome to say I don't think Mrs Desmond strong
enough, if you feel bound to tell a polite lie on the
subject."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>Honor had listened to the doctor's brusquely-delivered
speech with a growing sense of helplessness, as of a mouse
caught in a trap. His statement of the case was
uncomfortably plain. He left her no loophole of escape; and
by the time he fired his final question at her, she had
decided on present capitulation.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will take charge of him," she said. "Only Mrs
Desmond must have some share in the nursing&mdash;for his sake
and her own."</p>

<p>"Oh, well&mdash;well, I suppose she must. The less the better for
his sake; and you've got to consider Desmond before every
one else at present. I insist on that."</p>

<p>Honor smiled faintly at the superfluous injunction; and it
was at this point that Paul entered the room.</p>

<p>Mackay turned on him a face of open jubilation.</p>

<p>"Congratulate me, Wyndham! I've secured Miss Meredith's
services for Desmond."</p>

<p>"Thank God," Paul answered fervently; and he thanked Honor
also with his eyes.</p>

<p>"I shall move into the bungalow myself after the funeral,
and give you what help I can. He will need a good deal of
companionship to keep him from chafing at his helplessness.
He wished the Boy to be brought here and buried from his
house. I am making all arrangements; and we shall be round
quite early in the morning. Can I see Desmond again
to-night?"</p>

<p>Mackay pursed his lips.</p>

<p>"He'll do best with just the women-folk this evening. Look
in after Mess, if you like&mdash;last thing."</p>

<p>"Was Evelyn with him when you left?" Honor asked suddenly, a
flash of apprehension in her tone.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I must go and see what has come to her," she said, visibly
disturbed. "I shall see you both after Mess."</p>

<p>She hurried out, and listened intently at the study door. No
sound broke the stillness; and with an aching dread at her
heart she passed on to the next door.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>
<p>The brief dusk of India was already almost spent; and
finding Evelyn's room in semi-darkness, she paused on the
threshold.</p>

<p>"Are you there, dear?" she called softly; and was answered
by a stifled sound from the region of the bed, where Evelyn
lay prone, her face buried in the pillows. At that Honor
came forward, and laid a firm though a not unkindly hand
upon her.</p>

<p>"Evelyn, this is childish selfishness. Get up and go to him
at once."</p>

<p>The sole answer vouchsafed to her was a vehement shaking of
the fair head; a fresh paroxysm of distress.</p>

<p>"My dear&mdash;my dear," she urged, bending down and speaking
more softly, "you <i>must</i> pull yourself together. This is no
time to think of your own trouble. He is wounded, anxious,
and terribly unhappy and&mdash;he wants you. Do you call this
being a loyal wife? Remember, you promised&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, Evelyn lifted her head, supporting it on
one elbow, and showed a grief-disfigured face.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. But&mdash;couldn't you go to him, just for now,
Honor? You're not upset, like I am;&mdash;and say I&mdash;I'll come
when I'm better."</p>

<p>Honor went white to the lips.</p>

<p>"No, Evelyn," she said, her anger rising as she went on.
"There are things that even <i>I</i> must refuse to do for you. I
have done all that is in my power; but I <i>will</i> not take
your place with&mdash;your husband."</p>

<p>Astonishment checked Evelyn's sobbing, and a spark of
unreasoning jealousy shot through the mist of her tears.</p>

<p>"I don't <i>want</i> you to take my place with him. He's <i>mine</i>!"</p>

<p>"Then don't ask me to go to him now."</p>

<p>The counter-stroke was unanswerable. Evelyn made a genuine
attempt to still the uncontrolled quivering of her body, and
actually got upon her feet. But abandonment to misery had so
shaken her that, even as Honor put out a steadying hand, she
fell back among her pillows with a choking sob.</p>

<p>"It's no use," she moaned. "Go, Honor&mdash;go <i>now</i>; and say
I&mdash;I'm coming."</p>

<p>The girl set her teeth hard. A strange light gleamed in the
blue of her eyes. She moved across to the washing-stand and
poured out a stiff dose of sal volatile.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>
<p>"Here, Evelyn," she said, all the tenderness gone from her
voice, "drink this at once. Then get up as soon as you can,
and make yourself presentable. I shall not be gone many
minutes, and you <i>must</i> be ready to go to him the instant I
come back."</p>

<p>Evelyn choked and spluttered over the burning mixture.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, Honor, thank you. Only&mdash;don't look so angry
about it, please."</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> angry&mdash;I am bitterly angry," Honor answered with
sudden vehemence, and went quickly from the room.</p>

<p>Once outside, she paused; her whole soul uplifted in a
wordless prayer for strength and self-control. It seemed to
her that Evelyn's reception of Theo went far to make her own
departure a matter of imperative necessity, cruelly hard
though it was to risk being misjudged at such a crisis.</p>

<p>With heart and spirit braced for her ordeal, she entered the
room.</p>

<p>But at sight of him, who was the incarnation of life,
cheerfulness, and vigour, lying stricken in heart and body,
her courage deserted her, and she could neither speak nor
move. On the lower end of the long chair Rob nestled in an
attitude of perplexed watchfulness; satisfaction and
bewilderment contending for the mastery over his faithful
soul; and Desmond's right arm supported his stunned and
aching head.</p>

<p>As Honor paused on the threshold, he stirred uneasily. "That
you, Ladybird?" he asked; and his tone, if listless, was
unmistakably tender.</p>

<p>"No, Theo. It is I&mdash;Honor," the girl answered in a low voice
without moving forward.</p>

<p>"Where's Evelyn, then?"</p>

<p>"She's coming soon&mdash;very soon."</p>

<p>"What's gone wrong with her? Has she fainted? You might come
a little closer to a fellow, Honor. I feel cut off from
everything and every one, with this damnable green wall in
front of my eyes."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>
<p>At that cry from the man's tormented heart all thought of
her own pain, all doubt as to her own strength, was
submerged by a flood-tide of pure human compassion; and she
came to him straightway, kneeling close beside his chair,
and laying one hand lightly on the rug that covered him.</p>

<p>"There, Theo&mdash;there. Can you see me a little now?" she asked
tenderly. "You mustn't think hard things
of&mdash;Ladybird&mdash;please. She let herself go so completely after
seeing you in the verandah, and it was impossible for her to
come to you while she was in such a state of collapse. I
have given her a strong dose of sal volatile, and she begged
me to explain things to you; so&mdash;I came. I can't tell you
how sorry I was that it should be&mdash;only me."</p>

<p>He raised his head at that.</p>

<p>"You've the grit of all the Merediths in you, Honor," he
said, and his changed tone assured her that she had, in some
measure, fulfilled her purpose. "I can't have you talking
about 'only me' in that deprecating fashion. Goodness knows
what Ladybird would have done without you. No doubt she'll
pull herself together when she has got more used to the
hideousness of it all&mdash;myself included&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She will&mdash;I am sure she will," the girl declared with
pardonable insincerity; "and I really believe that if&mdash;if
<i>I</i> were not here, Evelyn might make more of an effort to
stand on her own feet than she does now. Please don't
misunderstand me, Theo,"&mdash;her brave voice faltered on the
words&mdash;"please believe that I myself would far rather be
here at a time like this. I would not dream of deserting my
post if I were not quite sure that there are many others
ready to look after you as carefully and willingly as I
would do myself. Indeed, I am honestly suggesting what I
think would be best for us all round&mdash;Evelyn especially.
Won't you let me go, Theo, and at least try how it works?"</p>

<p>Desmond shook his head with cautious deliberation, since
hasty movements had proved to be dangerous.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>
<p>"My dear Honor," he objected, "you, who know Ladybird even
better than I do, must surely know by now that nothing will
force her to stand upon her own feet. To-day gives final
proof of it. What's more, Paul will probably establish
himself here. I can't have him criticising her, even in his
own mind; and who but you can I rely on to prevent it, by
keeping her up to the mark? You see, I am taking you at your
word, and not misunderstanding you, and I ask you frankly to
stand by us till this trouble is over, when you shall both
go straight to the Hills."</p>

<p>"Very well, Theo; I will stay."</p>

<p>But her voice had an odd vibration in it. There was no
refusing a request so worded; but she knew her decision was
only deferred to a more seasonable moment.</p>

<p>"Thank you with all my heart," he said. "You'll not regret
it, I feel certain."</p>

<p>During the pause that followed, the wounded man made a
futile attempt to change his position. In an instant her
hands were at his pillows, shifting them quickly and
dexterously, supporting his shoulders with her arm the
while.</p>

<p>"There, that's better, isn't it?" she asked; and the
mother-note sounded in her voice.</p>

<p>"It's just beautiful, thank you. Now&mdash;I want Ladybird."</p>

<p>Honor's colour ebbed at the words, and she may be forgiven
if a pang of rebellion stabbed her. All the hard tasks, it
seemed, were to be hers; while for Evelyn was reserved the
full measure of a love and tenderness which she seemed
little able to rate to their true value. But there was no
trace of emotion in her voice as she replied, "You shall
have her at once; only she mustn't stay long. You have
already talked more than is good for you."</p>

<p>"Talked?" he echoed, with a sudden outburst of impatience.
"What else is there for me to do? I can neither read, nor
write, nor move. Am I to lie here like a log, with my own
black thoughts for company? I'm not ill, in spite of all."</p>

<p>"No, Theo, you are not ill now," the girl reasoned with him
in all gentleness, "but with a wound like that so near your
temple you soon will be ill, if you refuse to be moderately
careful. Evelyn shall stay for a quarter of an hour. After
that you <i>must please</i> obey me and lie quiet, so as to get a
little sleep, if possible, after your cruel journey. Amar
Singh shall sit here, and I will leave the drawing-room door
open and play to you;&mdash;something invigorating&mdash;the Pastoral,
to start with. Will that do?"</p>

<p>His prompt penitence caught at her heart.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>
<p>"Forgive me, Honor," he said. "I was an ungrateful brute,
and you're a long way too good to me. I'll obey orders in
future, without kicking against the pricks. The music will
be no end of a comfort. Just like you to think of it!"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the bedroom door opened, Desmond lifted his head, in a
distracted attempt to see more of his wife than the shade
would permit, and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Come, Ladybird. I want you."</p>

<p>She came at his bidding, and put her hand in his. But,
unwittingly, she stood no nearer than the action demanded;
and in her bewildered misery she forgot that he would expect
her to stoop and kiss him. It was a fatal omission&mdash;how
fatal she did not realise till later.</p>

<p>He drew her closer with quiet decision; and she submitted,
as she would have submitted to anything he might have chosen
to do just then.</p>

<p>"Am I so very dreadful that you can't bear to come near me?"
he asked, with a brave attempt at lightness.</p>

<p>"Oh, Theo, don't say that," she pleaded. It came too
painfully near the truth. "Only&mdash;I can't seem able to
believe that&mdash;it is really you."</p>

<p>"Well, I give you my word it <i>is</i> really me&mdash;the very same
Theo who won the Punjab Cup, and danced with you at Lahore
three months ago." Then he bit his lip sharply; for the
thought smote him that he might never sit a pony or dance
with her again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>
<p>The sob that had been clutching at her throat escaped, in
spite of herself. "Lahore!" she murmured. "It was all so
beautiful at Lahore!"</p>

<p>"Don't cry about it, darling. It will be just as beautiful
again, in time. Sit down on the floor&mdash;here, close to me. I
can't get a sight of you any other way."</p>

<p>She sat down, but in such a position that he had only a
scant view of her tear-disfigured face. He pushed the damp
ringlets back from her forehead. In his eyes it was her
misfortune, rather than her fault, that she should be so
inexorably chained to her own trouble.</p>

<p>Her spirit and her love revived under the magic of his
touch. She caught his hand and pressed it against her
burning cheek. It was cool and steady and sustaining&mdash;the
hand of a brave man.</p>

<p>"Poor child," he said gently. "I'm an uncomfortable sort of
husband for you. But little accidents of this kind will
happen to soldiers. Don't say you wish you hadn't married
this one!" And he smiled.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no. But, Theo, did you get all these wounds and things
trying to save the Boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes; more or less."</p>

<p>"And it wasn't a scrap of use?"</p>

<p>"No. One had the satisfaction of killing the men who did for
him. That was all!"</p>

<p>"And you might just as well have come back strong and
splendid, like you went away?"</p>

<p>"No use thinking of what might have been, darling. We've got
to set our teeth and face what <i>is</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, Theo&mdash;you are very brave."</p>

<p>"Needs must, Ladybird. If a man fails in that, he had better
not have been born. And you are going to be brave too,&mdash;my
wife."</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;I hope so. But&mdash;it's much more horrible than I ever
imagined; and if it's going on for weeks and weeks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The prospect so unnerved her that she leaned her head
against him, sobbing bitterly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't&mdash;I can't&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>
<p>The low cry came straight from her heart; and Desmond
understood its broken protest to the full. The effort to
uphold her was to be useless after all. He compressed his
lips and gently released her hand.</p>

<p>"If it's as bad as that, my dear, and you really feel it
will be too much for you," he said in a changed tone, "I
might arrange for Honor to take you away in a day or two,
till I am well enough to follow on. They all know here that
you are not strong. One need not degrade you by telling&mdash;the
whole truth."</p>

<p>"But, Theo, I couldn't leave you like that&mdash;just now, could
I?"</p>

<p>His smile had a hint of scorn.</p>

<p>"Goodness knows! There is nothing to prevent you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;there is!" she spoke hurriedly, with downcast eyes.
"Honor would never take me. She thinks it's dreadful that I
should go. I never saw her so angry before. She&mdash;she
said&mdash;terrible things&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good God! What do&mdash;you&mdash;mean?"</p>

<p>Desmond spoke slowly. Anger and amazement sounded in his
deep voice; and his wife saw what she had done.</p>

<p>"Theo!&mdash;Theo!" she cried, clasping her hands, and wringing
them in distraction at her own foolishness, "I never meant
to say that. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but you meant to do it," he said, breathing hard and
speaking with an effort. "You actually thought
of&mdash;going&mdash;before I came? You would have simply&mdash;bolted, and
left me to come back to an empty house, if Honor had not
prevented you? Great heavens! I can well believe she said
terrible things."</p>

<p>His wife knelt upright now and caught at his hand. But he
withdrew it hastily.</p>

<p>"Theo&mdash;will you listen to me and not be so angry? You are
very unkind!"</p>

<p>"Am I? Don't you think it is the other way about? I confess
I'm in no humour to listen to you just now. I've had about
as much as I can stand to-night; and Mackay told me I must
not upset myself about things." He laughed harshly&mdash;a sound
that chilled her blood. "But no mere man could anticipate
<i>this</i>!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, I never <i>meant</i> to say it, and I think you're
horrid, you don't understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No; thank God, I don't understand&mdash;cowardice and desertion.
Get up now and leave me alone, please. It's the greatest
kindness you can do me; and yourself also, I imagine."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that. It's not true; and I'm not going to
dream of leaving you. Won't you let me explain?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, Evelyn, to-morrow," he answered wearily. "I
shall be able to give you a fairer hearing by then; and I
pray God I may have misjudged you. Now&mdash;go."</p>

<p>She bent down and kissed his hand; then rose and slipped
silently back into her own room.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Theo Desmond lay motionless, like a man stunned. This third
blow, dealt him in quick succession, left him broken in
heart and spirit, as he had never been broken in all his
days.</p>

<p>It is written that a man must be defeated in order to
succeed; and in that moment Desmond bit the dust of the
heart's most poignant tragedy and defeat&mdash;the shattering of
faith in one who is very near to us. Nor was it the
shattering of faith alone. The shock of his wife's unwitting
revelation, coming when he stood supremely in need of her
loyalty and tenderness, struck a mortal blow at his love for
her; though in his present state he was not capable of
recognising the truth. He only knew that, for the first time
in his life, he felt unutterably alone&mdash;alone in a dimness
which might deepen to permanent darkness; and that the
wholesome vigorous realities of life seemed to have slipped
for ever out of reach. He only knew that his wife would have
turned her back upon him in his hour of extremity&mdash;openly
disgracing herself and him&mdash;but for the intervention of
Honor Meredith.</p>

<p>Her mere name called up a vivid vision of her beauty, a
remembrance of the infinite compassion in her voice when she
had knelt beside him, soothing and strengthening him by some
miracle of womanly intuition, urging him to make allowance
for his wife's distress.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>
<p>A sudden glow thrilled through him from head to foot. He
stirred slightly; and tried, without success, to turn in his
chair. It was as if the compelling spirit of her had dragged
him back from the brink of nothingness to renewed life, to
the assurance that in his utmost loneliness he was not&mdash;nor
ever would be&mdash;alone. And, in that moment of awakening, the
voice of sympathy came to him&mdash;tender, uplifting, clear as
speech.</p>

<p>Honor Meredith had begun to play.</p>

<p>By way of prelude she chose a piece of pure organ music&mdash;the
exquisitely simple Largo of the Second Sonata. From that she
passed on to the Pastoral itself, opening it, as of custom,
with the fine Andante movement&mdash;the presage of coming storm.</p>

<p>None among all that wondrous thirty-two is so saturate with
open-air cheerfulness and vigour as this Sonata, aptly
christened the Pastoral. Here we are made accomplices of
Nature's moods, and set in the midst of her voices. Here, in
swift succession, are storm and sunshine; falling
rain-drops; the plash and ripple of mountain streams; bird
notes of rare verisimilitude, from the anxious twitterings
before the thunder-shower, to the chorus of thanksgiving
after it has swept vigorously past. And Theo Desmond, lying
in semi-darkness, with pain for his sole comrade, knew that
the hand of healing had been again outstretched to him,&mdash;not
all in vain.</p>

<p>The Sonata ended in a brisk ripple of sound; and for a while
Honor sat motionless, her shapely hands resting on the
keyboard as if awaiting further inspiration.</p>

<p>Desmond moved again uneasily. He wondered what her unfailing
intuition of his need would lead her to play next; and even
as he wondered, expectancy was lulled into a great rest by
the measured tranquillity of Beethoven's most stately and
divine Adagio&mdash;the Moonlight Sonata.</p>

<p>There are some people who get deeper into a piano than
others, who breathe a living soul into the trembling wires.
The magic of Honor's music lay in this capacity; and she
exerted it now to the limit of her power.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>
<p>The Moonlight Sonata is cumulative from start to finish,
passing from the exalted calm of the Adagio, through the
graciousness of the Allegretto, to that inspired and
inspiring torrent of harmony the Presto Agitato. Its
incomparable effect of the rush and murmur of many waters,
through which the still small voice of melody rings clear as
a song dropped straight from heaven, leaves little room in a
listener's soul for the jangling discords of earth. Into
that movement the great deaf musician seems to have flung
the essence of his impatient spirit;&mdash;that rare mingling of
ruggedness and simplicity, of purity and passionate power,
which went to make up the remarkable character of the man,
and which sets Beethoven's music apart from the music of his
compeers. Wagner, Chopin, Grieg,&mdash;these range the whole
gamut of emotion for its own sake. But in the hands of the
master it becomes what it should be&mdash;the great uplifting
lever of the world.</p>

<p>The listener in the darkened room drew a long breath, and
clenched his teeth so forcibly that a spasm of pain passed,
like a fused wire, through the wound in his cheek. But the
keener stress of mind and heart dulled his senses to the
pin-prick of the flesh. For in the brief space of time since
the music began, Theo Desmond&mdash;the soldier of proven courage
and self-forgetfulness&mdash;had fought the most momentous battle
of his life;&mdash;a battle in which was no flourish of trumpets,
no clash of arms, no medal or honour for the winning.</p>

<p>But the price of conquest had still to be paid. There were
still practical issues to be faced, and he faced them with
the straightforward simplicity that was his. He saw as in a
lightning-flash, the hidden meaning of this girl's power to
stimulate and satisfy him; saw the unnameable danger ahead;
and in the same breath decided that Honor must go. There
must be no risk of disloyalty to Evelyn, were it only in
thought.</p>

<p>He could not as yet see how he was to retract his request
for her presence. His stunned brain refused to cope with
such harassing details. The thing must be said; and no doubt
he would find strength to say it aright. For him that was
enough; and he deliberately turned his back on the subject.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>
<p>The Presto was drawing to a close now in a cascade of
single notes, as stirring to the ear as the downrush of a
waterfall to the eye; and during the silence that followed
upon the last crashing chords, the bitter thought came to
him that Honor's departure would mean not only the loss of
her comradeship, but of the music, which had again become
one of the first necessities of his life.</p>

<p>With a sensation altogether strange to him, since it had in
it an element of fear, he heard her shut the piano and come
towards the door of his room. Closing his eyes, he lay very
still, in the hope that she might believe him to be asleep.
Ordinary speech with her seemed an impossibility just then.</p>

<p>He felt her come in, and pause beside his chair. His
stillness clearly deceived her, for she said nothing;
neither did she move away, as he had devoutly hoped she
would do.</p>

<p>Remembering that his eyes were hidden, he opened them; and
was rewarded by the sight of her cream-coloured skirt, and
her hands hanging loosely clasped upon it. An intolerable
longing came upon him to push off the shade; to satisfy
himself with one glimpse of her face before banishing it out
of his life. But strength was given him to resist, and to
realise his own cowardice in deceiving her thus.</p>

<p>Then, because he was incapable of doing anything by halves,
he made a slight movement and put out his hand.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said simply. "You have heartened me more
than I can say."</p>

<p>"I am so glad," she answered in a low tone, allowing her
hand to rest for a mere instant in his. "Now I want you to
shut all trouble out of your mind, and go to sleep for a
long time. Will you?"</p>

<p>At that the corners of his mouth went down.</p>

<p>"Easier said than done, I'm afraid. But it's sound advice;
and I'll do my best to act upon it."</p>

<p>"In that case&mdash;you are bound to succeed."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>
<p>And, without waiting for his possible answer, she slipped
quietly out of the room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wyndham,</span> returning to the bungalow soon after ten o'clock,
found it readjusted to its new conditions. Frank Olliver had
returned to her empty home; and Desmond, at his own request,
had had his camp-bed made up in the study, that he might in
no way disturb his wife. She herself had retired early,
without going in to him again. Honor noted and wondered at
the omission; but since Evelyn had said nothing about her
short interview with Theo, she forbore to question her or
press her unduly at the start.</p>

<p>When Paul arrived Desmond was sound asleep, wearied out with
pain of body and mind; while Honor moved noiselessly to and
fro, setting in readiness all that might be wanted before
morning. Paul came armed with Mackay's permission to remain
on duty for the night, taking what little rest he required
on the drawing-room sofa, and Honor could not withhold a
smile at his satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I believe you're jealous!" she said. "You want to oust me,
and have him all to yourself!"</p>

<p>"You are right," he answered frankly; and going over to the
bed, stood looking upon his friend in an unspeakable
content, that even anxiety was powerless to annul.</p>

<p>For all that, it was late before Honor managed to leave her
patient, and slip away into the bare room where Harry Denvil
lay awaiting the dawn.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>
<p>Save for the long scar across his face, no suggestion of
that last desperate fight was visible; and in the presence
of the Great Silence, her own turmoil of heart and brain was
stilled as at the touch of a reassuring hand. She knelt a
long while beside the Boy. It pleased her to believe that he
was in some way aware of her companionship; that perhaps he
was even glad of it&mdash;glad that she should feel no lightest
shrinking from the temple that had enshrined the brave jewel
of his soul.</p>

<p>Arrived in her own room, she found Parbutti huddled on the
ground, in a state of damp and voluble distress. She could
not bring herself to dismiss the old woman at once; though
her heart cried out for solitude, and weariness seemed
suddenly to dissolve her very bones. She saw now that her
love had deepened and strengthened during Desmond's absence,
as great love is apt to do; and the shock of his return,
coupled with the scant possibility of her own escape, had
tried her fortitude more severely than she knew.</p>

<p>She submitted in silence to the exchanging of her tea-gown
for a white wrapper, and to the loosening of her hair,
Parbutti crooning over her ceaselessly the while.</p>

<p>"Now I will soothe your Honour's head till weariness be
forgotten, O my Miss Sahib, daughter of my heart! Sleep
without dreams, my life; and have no fear for the Captain
Sahib, who is surely favoured of the gods by reason of his
great courage."</p>

<p>While her tongue ran on, the wrinkled hands moved skilfully
over the girl's head and neck, fingering each separate
nerve, and stilling the throbbing pulses by that mystery of
touch, which we of the West are just beginning to acquire,
but which is a common heritage in the East.</p>

<p>"Go now, Parbutti," Honor commanded at length. "Thy fingers
be miracle-workers. It is enough."</p>

<p>And as Parbutti departed, praising the gods, Honor leaned
her chin upon her hands, and frankly confronted the decision
that must be arrived at before morning.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>
<p>To her inner consciousness it seemed wrong and impossible
to fulfil her promise and remain; while to all outward
appearance it seemed equally wrong and impossible to go. She
could not see clearly. She could only feel intensely; and
her paramount feeling at the moment was that God asked of
her more than human nature could achieve.</p>

<p>The man's weakness and dependence awakened in her the
strongest, the divinest element of a woman's love, and with
it the longing to uphold and help him to the utmost limit of
her power. It was this intensity of longing which convinced
her that, at all costs, she must go. Yet at the first
thought of Evelyn her invincible arguments fell back like a
defeated battalion.</p>

<p>If she had sought the Frontier in the hope of coming into
touch with life's stern realities, her hope had been
terribly fulfilled.</p>

<p>"Dear God, what <i>ought</i> I to do?" she murmured on a note of
passionate appeal. But no answer came out of the stillness;
and sheer human need was too strong upon her for prayer.</p>

<p>Rising impulsively, she went over to the wide-flung door
that led into the back verandah, and rolled up the "chick,"
flooding the room with light; for a full moon rode high in
the heavens, eclipsing the fire of the stars. She stepped
out into the verandah, and passed to the far end, that
looked across a strip of rocky desolation to the hills.</p>

<p>The whole world slept in silver, its radiance intensified by
patches of blue-black shadow; and with sudden distinctness
her night journey of a year ago came back to her mind. What
an immeasurable way she had travelled since then! And how
far removed was the buoyant-hearted girl of that March
morning from the woman who rebelled with all her soul
against the cup of bitterness, even while she drank it to
the dregs!</p>

<p>Deliberately she tried to gather into herself something of
the night's colossal calm, to wrest from the starved scrub
of the desert a portion of its patience, its astounding
perseverance; to stifle her craving for clear unprejudiced
human counsel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>
<p>By a natural impulse her thought turned to Mrs Conolly, who
alone possessed both will and power to satisfy her need. To
speak of her own trouble was a thing outside the pale of
possibility. Death itself were preferable. But to consult
her friend as to what would really be best for Evelyn was
quite another matter. She would go and see Mrs Conolly
before breakfast and be ruled by her unfailing wisdom.</p>

<p>Having arrived at one practical decision, her mind grew
calmer. She went back to her room, lowered the "chick" and
knelt for a long while beside her bed&mdash;a white, gracious
figure, half-veiled by a dusky curtain of hair.</p>

<p>Habit woke her before seven; and she dressed briskly,
heartened by a sense of something definite to be done. A
sound of many feet and hushed voices told her that Wyndham
and the Pioneer officers had arrived. Chaplains were rare on
the Border in those days; and Wyndham was to read the
service, as he did on most occasions, Sundays included.</p>

<p>When Honor came out into the hall she found the chick rolled
up and the verandah a blaze of full-dress uniforms. No man
plays out his last act with more of pomp and circumstance
than a soldier; and there is a singular fitness in this
emphasis on the dignity rather than the tragedy of death.</p>

<p>The girl remained standing afar off, watching the scene,
whose brilliance was heightened by an untempered April sun.</p>

<p>A group of officers, moving aside, revealed two scarlet rows
of Pioneers; and beyond them Paul's squadron, striking a
deeper note of blue and gold. The band was drawn up ready to
start. Slanting rays flashed cheerfully from the brass of
trumpets, cornets, bassoons; from the silver fittings of
flutes; from the gold on scarlet tunics. And in the midst of
this ordered brilliance stood the gun-carriage, grey and
austere, its human burden hidden under the folds of the
English flag. Behind the gun-carriage the Boy's charger
waited, with an air of uncomplaining weariness, the boots
hanging reversed over the empty saddle.</p>

<p>With an aching lump in her throat Honor turned away. At that
moment the shuddering vibrations of muffled drums ushered in
the "Dead March" and each note fell on her heart like a
blow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>
<p>In passing the study door she paused irresolute, battling
with that refractory heart of hers, which refused to sit
quiet in its chains. It argued now that, after all, she was
his nurse; she had every right to go in and see that all was
well with him. But conscience and the hammering of her
pulses warned her that the greater right was&mdash;to refrain;
and straightening herself briskly, she went out through the
back verandah to Mrs Conolly's bungalow.</p>

<p>She had not been gone twenty minutes when Evelyn crept into
the study, so softly that her husband was not aware of her
presence till her fingers rested upon his hand.</p>

<p>He started, and took hold of them.</p>

<p>"That you?" he said gently. "Good-morning."</p>

<p>There was no life in his tone; and its apathy&mdash;so incredible
a quality in him&mdash;gave her courage.</p>

<p>"Theo," she whispered, kneeling down by him, "is it any good
trying to speak to you now? Will you believe that&mdash;I am ever
so sorry? I have been miserable all night; and I am not
frightened any more,&mdash;see!" In token of sincerity she
caressed his empty coat-sleeve. "Will you please&mdash;forgive
me? Will you?"</p>

<p>"With all my heart, Ladybird," he answered quietly. "But
it's no use speaking. A thing like that can't be explained
away. It is simply wiped off the slate&mdash;you understand?" And
almost before the words were out she had kissed him.</p>

<p>Then she slid down into a sitting position, one arm flung
lightly across the rug that covered him.</p>

<p>In that instant the thunder of three successive volleys
shook the house; and heart-stirring trumpet-notes sounded
the Last Post. With a small shudder Evelyn shrank closer to
her husband, resting her head against his chair; and Desmond
lay watching her in silent wonderment at the tangle of moods
and graces which, for lack of a truer word, must needs be
called her character. He wondered also how much might have
been averted if she had come to him thus yesterday instead
of to-day. Impossible to guess. He could only wrench his
thoughts away from the forbidden subject; and try to beat
down the strong new yearning that possessed him, by
occasionally stroking his wife's hair.</p>

<p>It is when we most crave for bread that life has this
ironical trick of presenting us with a stone.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>
<p>Honor, in the meanwhile, had reached Mrs Conolly's
bungalow. She found her in the drawing-room arranging
flower-vases, and equipped for her morning ride.</p>

<p>"Honor? You? How delightful!" Then catching a clearer view
of the girl's face: "My dear&mdash;what is it?"</p>

<p>Honor smiled.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you were going out," she said, evading the
question.</p>

<p>"Certainly I was; but I am not going now. It is evident that
you want me."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I want you."</p>

<p>Mrs Jim called out an order to the waiting <i>sais</i>; and
followed Honor, who had gone over to the mantelpiece, and
buried her face in the cool fragrance of a cluster of Gloire
de Dijons.</p>

<p>Mrs Conolly took her gently by the arm.</p>

<p>"I can't have you looking like that, my child," she said.
"Your eyes are like saucers, with indigo shadows under them.
Did you sleep a wink last night?"</p>

<p>"Not many winks; that's why I am here."</p>

<p>"I see. You must be cruelly anxious about Captain Desmond,
as we all are; but I <i>will not</i> believe that the worst can
happen."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;oh no!" Honor spoke as if she were beating off an
enemy. "But the trouble that kept me awake was&mdash;Evelyn."</p>

<p>"Ah! Is the strain going to be too much for her? Come to the
sofa, dear, and tell me the whole difficulty."</p>

<p>Honor hesitated. She had her own reasons for wishing to
avoid Mrs Conolly's too sympathetic scrutiny.</p>

<p>"You sit down," she said. "I feel too restless. I would
rather speak first." And with a hint of inward perplexity
Mrs Conolly obeyed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>
<p>"It's like this," Honor began, resting an arm on the
mantelpiece and not looking directly at her friend, "Dr
Mackay has asked me to take entire charge of Theo for the
present. He spoke rather strongly,&mdash;rather cruelly, about
not leaving him in Evelyn's hands. I think he wanted to
force my consent; and for the moment I could not refuse. But
this is Evelyn's first big chance of rising above herself;
and if I step in and do everything I take it right out of
her hands. This seems to me so unfair that I have been
seriously wondering whether I ought not to&mdash;go right away
till the worst is over." And she reiterated the arguments
she had already put before Theo, as much in the hope of
convincing herself as her friend.</p>

<p>Mrs Conolly, watching her with an increasing thoughtfulness,
divined some deeper complication beneath her unusual
insistence on the wrong point of view; and awaited the sure
revelation that would come when it would come.</p>

<p>"You see, don't you," Honor concluded, in a beseeching tone,
"that it is not easy to make out what is really best, what
is right to be done? And Evelyn's uncertainty makes things
still more difficult. One moment I feel almost sure she
would 'find herself' if I were not always at her elbow; and
the next I feel as if it would be criminal to leave her
unsupported for five minutes at a time like this."</p>

<p>"That last comes nearer the truth than anything you have
said yet," was Mrs Jim's unhesitating verdict. "Frankly,
Honor, I agree with Dr Mackay; and I must really plead with
you to leave off splitting straws about your 'Evelyn,' and
to think of Captain Desmond&mdash;and Captain Desmond only.
Surely you care more for him, and for what comes to him,
than your line of argument seems to imply?"</p>

<p>Honor drew herself up as if she had been struck. The appeal
was so unlooked for, the implication so unendurable, that
for an instant she lost her balance. A slow colour crept
into her cheeks, a colour drawn from the deepest wells of
feeling; and while she stood blankly wondering how she might
best remedy her mistake, Mrs Conolly's voice again came to
her ears.</p>

<p>"Indeed, my child, you spoke truth just now," she said
slowly, a fresh significance in her tone. "It must be <i>very</i>
hard for you to make out what is right."</p>

<p>Honor threw up her head with a gesture of defiance.</p>

<p>"Why should you suddenly say that?" she demanded, almost
angrily. But the instant her eyes met those of her friend
the unnameable truth flashed between them clear as speech
and with a stifled sound Honor hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>
<p>Followed a tense silence; then Mrs Conolly came to her and
put an arm round her. But the girl stiffened under the touch
of sympathy implying mutual knowledge of that which belonged
only to herself and God.</p>

<p>"How could I dream that you would guess?" she murmured,
without uncovering her face&mdash;"that you would even imagine
such a thing to be possible?"</p>

<p>"My dearest," the other answered gently, "I am old enough to
know that, where the human heart is concerned, all things
are possible."</p>

<p>"But I can't endure that you should know; that you
should&mdash;think ill of me."</p>

<p>"You know me very little, Honor, if you can dream of that
for a moment. Come and sit down. No need to hold aloof from
me now."</p>

<p>Honor submitted to be led to the sofa, and drawn down close
beside her friend. The whole thing seemed to have become an
incredible nightmare.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, my child," Mrs Conolly began, the
inexpressible note of mother-love sounding in her voice. "I
want you to realise, once for all, how I regard this matter.
I think you know how much I have loved and admired you, and
I do so now&mdash;more than ever. An overwhelming trouble has
come upon you, by no will of your own; and you are evidently
going to meet it with a high-minded courage altogether
worthy of your father's daughter."</p>

<p>Honor shivered.</p>

<p>"Don't speak of father," she entreated. "Only&mdash;now that you
understand, tell me&mdash;tell me&mdash;what <i>must</i> I do?"</p>

<p>The passionate appeal coming from this girl&mdash;apt rather to
err in the direction of independence&mdash;stirred Mrs Jim's big
heart to its depths.</p>

<p>"You will abide by my decision?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; I am ready to do anything for&mdash;either of them."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>
<p>"Bravely spoken, my dear. In that case I can only say,
'Stand to your guns.' You have promised to take over charge
of Captain Desmond, and a soldier's daughter should not
dream of deserting her post. Mind you, I would not give such
advice to ninety-nine girls out of a hundred in your
position. The risk would be too serious; and I only dare
give it to you because I am <i>sure</i> of you, Honor. I quite
realise why you feel you ought to go. But your own feelings
must simply be ignored. Your one hope lies in starving them
to death, if possible. Give Evelyn her chance by all means,
but I can't allow you to desert Captain Desmond on her
account. You must be at hand to protect him, and uphold her,
in case of failure. In plain English, you must consent to be
a mere prop&mdash;putting yourself in the background and leaving
her to reap the reward. It is the eternal sacrifice of the
strong for the weak. You are one of the strong; and in your
case there is no shirking the penalty without an imputation
that could never be coupled with the name of Meredith."</p>

<p>Honor looked up at that with a characteristic tilt of her
chin, and Mrs Conolly's face softened to a smile.</p>

<p>"Am I counselling cruelly hard things, dear?" she asked
tenderly.</p>

<p>"No, indeed. If you were soft and sympathetic, I should go
away at once. You have shown me quite clearly what is
required of me. It will not be&mdash;easy. But one can do no less
than go through with it&mdash;in silence."</p>

<p>Mrs Conolly sat looking at the girl for a few seconds. Then:</p>

<p>"My dear, I am very proud of you," she said with quiet
sincerity. "I can see that you have drawn freely on a
Strength beyond your own. Just take victory for granted; and
do your simple human duty to a sick man who is in great need
of you, and whose fortune or misfortune is a matter of real
concern to many others besides those near and dear to him. I
know I am not exaggerating when I say that if any serious
harm came to Captain Desmond it would be a calamity felt not
only by his regiment, but by more than half the Frontier
Force. He has the 'genius to be loved,' that is perhaps the
highest form of genius&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I know. Don't talk about him, please."</p>

<p>"Ah! but that is part of your hard programme, Honor. You
must learn to talk of him, and to let others talk of him.
Only you must banish him altogether <i>out of your own
thoughts</i>. You see the difference?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I see the difference."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>
<p>"The essence of danger lies there, and too few people
recognise it. I believe that half the emotional catastrophes
of life might be traced back to want of self-control in the
region of thought. The world's real conquerors are those who
'hold in quietness their land of the spirit'; and you have
the power to be one of them if you choose."</p>

<p>"I do choose," Honor answered in a low level voice, looking
straight before her.</p>

<p>"Then the thing is as good as done." She rose on the words,
and drew Honor to her feet. "There; I think I have said hard
things enough for one day."</p>

<p>Honor looked very straightly into the elder woman's strong
plain face.</p>

<p>"I know you don't expect me to thank you," she said; "we
understand each other too well for that. And we will never
speak of this again, please. It is dead and buried from
to-day."</p>

<p>"Of course. That is why I have spoken rather fully this
morning. But be sure you will be constantly in my thoughts,
and&mdash;in my prayers."</p>

<p>Then she took possession of the girl, holding her closely
for a long while; and when they moved apart tears stood in
her eyes, though she was a woman little given to that
luxury.</p>

<p>"This has been a great blow to me, dear," she said. "I had
such high hopes for you. I had even thought of Major
Wyndham."</p>

<p>Honor smiled wearily.</p>

<p>"It was perverse of me. I suppose it ought to have
been&mdash;Paul."</p>

<p>"I wish it had been, with all my heart; and I confess I am
puzzled about you two. How has he come to be 'Paul' within
this last fortnight?"</p>

<p>"It is simply that we have made a compact. He knows now that
he can never be anything more than&mdash;Paul&mdash;the truest friend
a woman ever had."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow! So there are two of you wasted!"</p>

<p>"Is any real love ever wasted?" Honor asked so simply that
Mrs Conolly kissed her again.</p>

<p>"My child, you put me to shame. It is clearly I who must
learn from you. Now, go home; and God be with you as He very
surely will."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>
<p>Then with her head uplifted and her spirit braced to
unflinching endurance, Honor Meredith went out into the blue
and gold of the morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honor</span> found Evelyn in a state of chastened happiness,
buttering toast for Theo's breakfast, which stood ready on a
tray at her side.</p>

<p>"Would you like to take this in yourself?" she said, as she
completed her task. "I think he would be pleased. He was
asking where you were."</p>

<p>The suggestion was so graciously proffered that Honor
deposited a light kiss on the coiled floss silk of Evelyn's
hair as she bent above the table. Then she took up the tray,
and went on into the study.</p>

<p>She entered, and set it down without speaking; and Desmond,
who was lying back with closed eyes, roused himself at the
sound.</p>

<p>"Thank you, little woman," he said. Then, with a start, "Ah,
Honor,&mdash;it's you. Very kind of you to trouble.
Good-morning."</p>

<p>The contrast in his tone and manner was apparent, even in so
few words; and Honor was puzzled.</p>

<p>"I hope you got some sleep last night," she said, "after
that cruel thirty-six hours."</p>

<p>"More or less, thanks. But I had a good deal to say to Paul.
You and he seem to have become very close friends while I
have been away."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>
<p>"We have; permanently, I am glad to say. I should have come
in to you when I got up, but I was sure he would have done
everything you could want before leaving."</p>

<p>"He did; and he'll be back the minute he's through with his
work. He is an incomparable nurse; and with him at hand, I
shall not need to&mdash;trespass on so much of your time, after
all."</p>

<p>Honor bit her lip and tingled in every nerve, less at the
actual words than at the manner of their utterance&mdash;a
mingling of embarrassment and schooled politeness, which set
her at arm's length, checked spontaneity, and brought her
down from the heights with the speed of a dropped stone.</p>

<p>"It is not a question of trespassing on my time," she said,
and in spite of herself a hint of constraint invaded her
voice. "But I have no wish to deprive Paul of his privilege
and right. You can settle it with Dr Mackay between you.
Now, it's time you ate your breakfast. Can you manage by
yourself? Shall I send Evelyn to help you?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks; I can manage all right."</p>

<p>He knew quite well he could do nothing of the sort; but his
one need was to be alone.</p>

<p>"Very well. I shall be busy this morning with mail letters.
Evelyn will sit with you till Paul comes; and Frank is sure
to be round during the day. I pointed out to you yesterday
that there were plenty of&mdash;others able and willing to see
after you."</p>

<p>Before he could remonstrate she was gone. He drew in his
breath sharply, between set teeth, and struck the arm of his
chair with jarring force.</p>

<p>"I have hurt her&mdash;clumsy brute that I am. And I must do
worse before the day's out. But the sooner it's over the
better."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>
<p>It was his invariable attitude towards a distasteful duty;
and he decided not to let slip a second opportunity. Weak
and unaided, he made what shift he could to deal with the
intricacies of breakfast, choking back his irritability when
he found himself grasping empty air in place of the teapot
handle, sending the sugar-tongs clattering to the floor, and
deluging his saucer by pouring the milk outside the cup. For
the moment, to this man of independent spirit, these trivial
indignities seemed more unendurable than the loss of his
subaltern, the intrusive shadow threatening his
self-respect, or the fear of blindness, that lay upon his
heart cold and heavy as a corpse.</p>

<p>And on the other side of the door, Honor stood alone in the
drawing-room, trying to regain some measure of calmness
before returning to the breakfast-table.</p>

<p>Red-hot resentment fired her from head to foot. Resentment
against what, against whom? she asked herself blankly, and
in the same breath turned her back upon the answer. Chiefly
against herself, no doubt, for her inglorious descent from
the pinnacle of stoicism, to which she had climbed barely an
hour ago. It seemed that Love, coming late to these two, had
come as a refiner's fire, to "torment their hearts, till it
should have unfolded the capacities of their spirits." For
Love, like Wisdom, is justified of all her children.</p>

<p>Breakfast, followed by details of housekeeping, reinstated
common-sense. After all, since she had resolved to remain in
the background, Theo had simplified affairs by consigning
her to her destined position. She could quite well keep her
promise to Dr Mackay, and superintend all matters of moment,
without spending much time in the sick-room. Evelyn had
agreed to accept her share of the nursing; and, as she had
said, there were others, whose right was beyond her own.</p>

<p>Shortly after tiffin, Wyndham arrived with Rajinder Singh;
and finding them together in the drawing-room&mdash;after the
short interview permitted by Paul&mdash;Honor took the
opportunity of fulfilling a request made by Theo on the
previous evening.</p>

<p>"I have to write to Mrs Denvil," she said to Paul. "Would
the Sirdar mind giving me a few details about the fighting
on the 17th?"</p>

<p>Paul glanced approvingly at the old Sikh, who stood beside
him, a princely figure of a man, in the magnificent mufti
affected by the native cavalry officer&mdash;a long coat of
peach-coloured brocade, and a turban of the same tint.</p>

<p>"Mind? He needs very little encouragement to enlarge on
Theo's share in the proceedings."</p>

<p>"I would like to hear all he can tell me about that," she
answered on a low note of fervour.</p>

<p>"You could follow him, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, perfectly."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>
<p>"You hear, Ressaldar Sahib." Paul turned to his companion.
"The Miss Sahib desires full news of the attack and
engagement on Tuesday morning, that she may write of it to
England."</p>

<p>The man's eyes gleamed under his shaggy brows, and he
launched into the story, nothing loth; his eloquence rising
as he warmed to the congenial theme.</p>

<p>Paul Wyndham stepped back a few paces into a patch of
shadow, the better to watch Honor Meredith at his ease. She
had balanced herself lightly on the arm of a chair; and now
leaned a little forward, her lips just parted in the
eagerness of anticipation. A turquoise medallion on a fine
gold chain made a single incident of colour on the habitual
ivory tint of her gown; threads of burnished copper glinted
among the coils of her hair; and the loyal loving soul of
her shone like a light through the seriousness of her eyes.</p>

<p>And as he watched, hope&mdash;that dies harder than any quality
of the heart&mdash;rose up in him and prevailed. A day must come
when this execrable unknown would no longer stand between
them; when she would come to him of her own accord, as she
had promised;&mdash;and he could wait for years, without
impatience, on the bare chance of such a consummation.</p>

<p>But at this point a growing change in her riveted his
attention&mdash;a change such as only the eyes of a lover could
detect and interpret aright. She sat almost facing him; and
at the first had looked towards him, from time to time,
certain of his sympathy with the interest that held her. But
before five minutes were out he had been forgotten as though
he were not; and by how all else about her was forgotten
also. Not her spirit only, but her whole heart glowed in her
eyes; and Paul Wyndham, standing watchful and silent in the
shadow, became abruptly aware that the execrable
unknown&mdash;whom he had been hating for the past fortnight with
all the strength of a strong nature&mdash;was the man he loved
better than anything else on earth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>
<p>The Ressaldar was nearing the crowning-point of his story
now. Honor listened spellbound as he told her of the
breathless rush up that rugged incline, and of the sight
that greeted them after scaling the mighty staircase of
rock.</p>

<p>"None save the fleetest among us could keep pace with the
Captain Sahib, wounded as he was," the Sikh was saying, when
Wyndham, with a hideous jar, came back to reality. "But God
gave me strength, though I have fifty years well told, so
that I came not far behind; and even as Denvil Sahib fell,
with his face to the earth, at the Captain Sahib's feet, he
turned upon the Afridi devils like a lion among wolves, and
smote three of them to hell before a man could say, 'It
lightens.' Yet came there one pig of a coward behind him,
Miss Sahib. Only, by God's mercy, I also was there, to give
him such greeting as he deserved with my Persian sword, that
hath passed from father to son these hundred and fifty
years, and hath never done better work than in averting the
hand of death from my Captain Sahib Bahadur, whom God will
make Jungi-Lat-Sahib<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> before the end of his days! For
myself I am an old man, and of a truth I covet no higher
honour than this that hath befallen me, in rendering twice,
without merit, such good service to the Border. Nay, but who
am I that I should speak thus? Hath not the Miss Sahib
herself rendered a like service? May your honour live long,
and be the mother of heroes!"</p>

<p>Rajinder Singh bowed low on the words, which brought the
girl to her feet and crimsoned her clear skin from chin to
brow. By a deft question she turned the tide of talk into a
less embarrassing channel; and Paul Wyndham, pulling himself
together with an effort, went noiselessly out of the room.</p>

<p>Passing through the hall, he sought the comparative privacy
of the back verandah, which was apt to be deserted at this
time of day. Here he confronted the discovery that tortured
him&mdash;denied it; wrestled with it; and finally owned himself
beaten by it. There was no evading the witness of his own
eyes; and in that moment it seemed to him that he had
reached the limit of endurance. Then a sudden question
stabbed him. How far was Theo responsible for that which had
come about? Was he, even remotely, to blame?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>
<p>Had any living soul dared to breathe such questions in his
hearing Wyndham would have knocked the words down his
throat, and several teeth along with them, man of peace
though he was. But the very depth of his feeling for Desmond
made him the more clear-eyed and stern in judgment; and the
intolerable doubt, uprising like a mist before his inner
vision, held him motionless, forgetful of place and time;
till footsteps roused him, and he turned to find Honor
coming towards him.</p>

<p>"Why, Paul," she said, "what brings you here? I have been
looking for you everywhere. I thought you had gone to him.
Evelyn says he is alone, and he wants you."</p>

<p>The unconscious use of the pronoun did not escape Paul's
notice, and he winced at it, as also at the undernote of
reproof in her tone.</p>

<p>"Sorry to have kept him waiting," he said quietly, and for
the first time his eyes avoided her face. "I will go to him
at once."</p>

<p>But on opening the study door he hesitated, dreading the
necessity for speech; glad&mdash;actually glad&mdash;that his face was
hidden from his friend. For all the depth of their reserve,
the shadow of restraint was a thing unknown between them.
But the world had been turned upside down for Wyndham since
he left the familiar room half an hour ago. A spark that
came very near to anger burned in his heart.</p>

<p>Desmond turned in his chair. Two hours of undiluted Evelyn
had left him craving for mental companionship.</p>

<p>"Paul, old man," he said on a questioning note, "can't you
speak to a fellow? Jove! what wouldn't I give for a good
square look at you! It's poor work consorting with folk who
only exist from the waist downward. You've not got to be
running off anywhere else, have you?"</p>

<p>"No; I am quite free."</p>

<p>"Come on then, for Heaven's sake, dear chap! I have been
wanting you all the morning."</p>

<p>The direct appeal, the pathos of his shattered vigour, and
the irresistible friendliness of words and tone dispelled
all possibility of doubt, or of sitting in judgment.
Whatever appearances might suggest, Paul stood ready to
swear, through thick and thin, to the integrity of his
friend.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>
<p>He came forward at once; and Desmond, cavalierly ousting
Rob, made room for him on the lower end of his chair.</p>

<h4>YOU SHALL NOT&mdash;!</h4>

Moreover, my own soul forbiddeth me."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Homer.</span></span><br />
<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Quite</span> a little party of a quiet kind assembled in the
drawing-room for tea&mdash;Frank Olliver, Mrs Conolly, Wyndham,
and his subaltern George Rivers, a promising probationer of
a year's standing. The funeral of the morning, and anxiety
as to the fate of Desmond's eyes, gave a subdued tone to the
attempt at cheerfulness that prevailed. But Evelyn was
grateful even for so mild a reversion to a more normal
condition of things.</p>

<p>Each in turn had paid a short visit to the wounded hero in
the study; but now they were grouped round the tea-table,
leaving him temporarily alone. Evelyn had just filled his
cup; and being in no mood to interrupt her exchange of
light-hearted nothings with George Rivers, she glanced
across at Wyndham, who promptly understood the situation and
the mute request.</p>

<p>Honor, standing apart from the rest, noted the
characteristic bit of by-play, and with a pang of envy
watched Paul receive the cup and plate destined for Theo's
room. It seemed a century since she had left him in the
morning, with words wrung from her bitterness of heart and
regretted as soon as they were uttered; and because of the
longing, that would not be stifled, she refrained from the
offer that came instinctively to her lips.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>
<p>But, as if drawn by the magnetism of her thoughts, Paul
came straight up to her.</p>

<p>"Won't you take these yourself?" he said in a low tone. "He
has seen plenty of me this afternoon; and when I spoke of
you just now he said you had not been near him since
breakfast. Is that your notion of taking charge of a
patient? It isn't mine, I can tell you!"</p>

<p>He spoke lightly, easily; for if life were to be tolerable,
the discovery he had made must be ignored, without and
within.</p>

<p>"It is not mine either," she answered, flushing at the
unmerited reproof. "But I am by way of handing over my
charge to you. Doesn't the arrangement suit you?"</p>

<p>"By all means. But Mackay rightly chose you. Besides, I am
not so selfish that I should want to deprive Theo of the
pleasure of your ministrations."</p>

<p>"Deprive him? You are judging him by yourself! It is hardly
a question of deprivation, surely."</p>

<p>Wyndham glanced at her keenly.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he said, "one doesn't expect that sort of tone from
you where Theo is concerned. What do you mean me to
understand by it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing at all! Only&mdash;he happens to prefer <i>your</i>
ministrations. He almost told me so. You or he can settle it
with Dr Mackay to-night. But I will take these in to him&mdash;if
you wish."</p>

<p>"Purely as a favour to me?"</p>

<p>Her face lit up with a gleam of irrepressible humour.</p>

<p>"Purely as a favour to you!"</p>

<p>She took the cup and plate from him, still smiling, and
passed on into the study.</p>

<p>As she bent above the table, Desmond lifted his head in a
vain effort to get a glimpse of her face.</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;thank you&mdash;how good of you!" he said, his
constraint softened by a repressed eagerness, which gave her
courage to speak her thought.</p>

<p>"Why am I suddenly to be discomfited by such elaborate
thanks, such scathing politeness?" she asked in a tone of
valiant good-humour.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean it to be scathing."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, it is. Overmuch thanks for small services is a poor
compliment to friendship. I thought you and I agreed on that
point."</p>

<p>He answered nothing. He was nerving himself to the effort of
decisive speech, which should set danger at arm's length and
end their distracting situation once for all.</p>

<p>She set the small table closer to his side.</p>

<p>"I will look in again, in case you should want some more,"
she said softly, "if you will promise me not to say 'thank
you!'"</p>

<p>"I promise," he answered with a half smile; and she turned
to go. But before she had reached the door his voice
arrested her.</p>

<p>"Honor,&mdash;one minute, please. I have something particular to
say."</p>

<p>The note of constraint was so marked that the girl stood
speechless, scarcely breathing, wondering what would come
next&mdash;whether his words would break down the barrier that
held them apart.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said at length, as he remained silent.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking," he began awkwardly, "over what you
said yesterday&mdash;about Evelyn. You remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And I have been wanting to tell you that I believe you were
right. You generally are. I believe we ought to give her the
chance you spoke of. Besides&mdash;I asked too much of you. This
may be a slow business; and really we have no right to trade
on your unselfishness to the extent I proposed. You
understand me?"</p>

<p>For the life of him he could not ask her to go outright; his
excuse appeared to him lame enough to be an insult itself. A
fierce temptation assailed him to push up the detested shade
and discover whether he had hurt this girl, who had done so
infinitely much for him. But he grasped the side of his
chair, keeping his arm rigid as steel; and awaited her
answer, which seemed an eternity in coming.</p>

<p>Indeed, if he had struck her, Honor could scarcely have been
more stunned, more indignant, than she was at that moment.
But when she found her voice it was at least steady, if not
devoid of emotion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>
<p>"No, Theo," she said. "For the first time in my life I
<i>don't</i> understand you. But I see clearly&mdash;what you wish;
and if you feel absolutely certain that you are making the
right decision for Evelyn, I have no more to say. For
myself, you are asking a far harder thing to-day than you
did yesterday. But that is no matter, if it is really best
for you both&mdash;I don't quite know what Dr Mackay will say. I
will see him about it this evening; and you will please tell
Evelyn&mdash;yourself."</p>

<p>He knew now that he had hurt her cruelly; and with knowledge
came the revelation that he was playing a coward's part in
rewarding her thus for all she had done; in depriving Evelyn
of her one support and shield, merely because he distrusted
his own self-mastery at a time of severe mental stress and
bodily weakness.</p>

<p>His imperative need for a sight of her face conquered him at
last. Quick as thought his hand went up to the rim of the
shade. But Honor was quicker still. The instinct to shield
him from harm swept everything else aside. In a second she
had reached him and secured his hand.</p>

<p>"You <i>shall not</i> do that!" she said&mdash;anger, fear,
determination vibrating in her low tone.</p>

<p>Then, to her astonishment, she found her own hand crushed in
his, with a force that brought tears into her eyes. But he
remained silent; and she neither spoke nor stirred. Emotion
dominated her; and her whole mind was concentrated on the
effort to hold it in leash.</p>

<p>For one brief instant they stood thus upon the brink of a
precipice&mdash;the precipice of mutual knowledge. But both were
safeguarded by the strength that belongs to an upright
spirit; and before three words could have been uttered
Desmond had dropped her hand, almost throwing it from him,
with a decisiveness that might have puzzled her, but that
she had passed beyond the region of surprise.</p>

<p>Still neither spoke. Desmond was breathing with the short
gasps of a man who has ran a great way, or fought a hard
fight; and Honor remained beside him, her eyes blinded, her
throat aching with tears that must not be allowed to fall.</p>

<p>At last she mastered them sufficiently to risk speech.</p>

<p>"What <i>have</i> I done that you should treat me&mdash;like this?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>
<p>There was more of bewilderment than of reproach in the
words, and Desmond, turning his head, saw the white marks
made by his own fingers upon the hand that hung at her side.</p>

<p>"Done?" he echoed, all constraint and coldness gone from his
voice. "You have simply proved yourself, for the hundredth
time&mdash;the staunchest, most long-suffering woman on God's
earth. Will you forgive me, Honor? Will you wipe out what I
said&mdash;and did just now? I am not quite&mdash;myself to-day; if
one dare proffer an excuse. Mackay is right, we can't do
without you&mdash;Evelyn least of any. Will you believe that, and
stay with us, in spite of all?"</p>

<p>He proffered his hand now, and she gave him the one that
still tingled from his pressure. He held it quietly,
closely, as the hand of a friend, and was rewarded by her
frank return of his grasp.</p>

<p>"Of course I will stay," she said simply. "But don't let
there be any talk of forgiveness between you and me, Theo.
To understand is to forgive. I confess I <i>have</i> been puzzled
since&mdash;yesterday evening, but now I think we do understand
one another again. Isn't that so?"</p>

<p>"Yes; we understand one another, Honor," he answered without
a shadow of hesitation; but in his heart he thanked God that
she did not understand&mdash;nor ever would, to her life's end.</p>

<p>Relief reawakened the practical element, which had been
submerged in the emotional. She was watching him now with
the eyes of a nurse rather than the eyes of a woman.</p>

<p>When he had spoken, his arm fell limply; and he leaned back
upon the pillows with a sigh of such utter weariness that
her anxiety was aroused. She remembered that his hand had
seemed unnaturally hot, and deliberately taking possession
of it again, laid her fingers on his wrist. The rapidity of
his pulse startled her; since she could have no suspicion of
all that he had fought against and held in check.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>
<p>"How <i>is</i> one to keep such a piece of quicksilver as you in
a state of placid stodge!" she murmured. "I suppose I ought
to have forbidden you to talk. But how could I dream
that&mdash;all this would come of it? You must lie absolutely
quiet and see no one for the rest of the evening. I will
send at once for Dr Mackay; and, look, your tea is all cold.
You shall have some fresh&mdash;very weak&mdash;it will do you good.
But not another word, please, to me or any one till I give
you leave."</p>

<p>"Very well; I'll do my best to remain in a state of placid
stodge, if that will ease your mind," he answered so humbly
that the tears started to her eyes afresh. "Won't you let me
smoke, though? Just one cigarette. It would calm me down
finely before Mackay comes."</p>

<p>Without answering she took one from his case and gave it to
him. Then, striking a match, held it for him, till the wisp
of paper and tobacco was well alight; while he lay back,
drawing in the fragrant smoke, with a sigh in which
contentment and despair were strangely mingled.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that, to the end of time, woman's higher
development will never eradicate her delight in ministering
to the minor comforts of the man she loves.</p>

<p>"As soon as I have seen Paul, and sent for Dr Mackay," Honor
said, "I will come back and stay with you altogether for the
present."</p>

<p>"Thank you." He smiled directly the word was out. "I forgot!
That's against regulations! But I swear it came straight
from my heart."</p>

<p>"In that case you are forgiven!" she answered, with a low
laugh.</p>

<p>It was such pure pleasure to have recaptured the old
spontaneous Theo, with whom one could say or do anything, in
the certainty of being understood, that even anxiety could
not quell the new joy at her heart.</p>

<p>Re-entering the drawing-room, she beckoned Wyndham with her
eyes and passed on into the hall. So surprisingly swift are
a woman's changes of mood, that by the time he joined her
anxiety had taken hold of her again, to the exclusion of all
else.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Paul, you did well to reprove me! We must send the
orderly for Dr Mackay at once. He has fever now&mdash;rather
high, I am afraid. Did you notice nothing earlier?"</p>

<p>"No; he seemed quiet enough when I was with him."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>
<p>"I think he has been worrying over something, apart from
his eyes and the Boy; but I can't get at the bottom of it.
No need to make the others anxious yet; only&mdash;I won't leave
him again. I intend to stick to my charge after all," she
added, with a sudden smile. "There was some sort
of&mdash;misunderstanding, it seems. I don't quite know what, but
there's an end of it now."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" The words were no mere formula on Paul
Wyndham's lips. "Misunderstandings are more poisonous than
snakes! Go straight back to him, and I'll send the orderly
flying in two minutes."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>There was little sleep for either Wyndham or Honor that
night.</p>

<p>The girl persuaded Evelyn to go early to bed, merely telling
her that as Theo was restless she would have to sit up with
him for a while; and Evelyn, secretly relieved at not being
asked to do the sitting up herself, deposited a light kiss
on her husband's hair and departed with a pretty air of
meekness that brought a smile to Honor's lips.</p>

<p>She had felt mildly happy and oppressively good all day. The
tea-party had helped to lighten the hushed atmosphere of the
house; and her last waking thought was of George Rivers'
deep-toned voice and frankly admiring eyes. She decided that
he might "do" in place of Harry Denvil, who must naturally
be forgotten as soon as possible; because it was so
uncomfortable to think of people who were dead.</p>

<p>Desmond's temperature rose rapidly; and the two, who could
not bear to leave his side, divided the night watches
between them. Amar Singh, his chin between his knees,
crouched dog-like on the mat outside the door, presenting
himself, from time to time, with such dumb yearning in his
eyes that Honor devised small services for him in pure
tenderness of heart.</p>

<p>Paul took a couple of hours' rest at midnight, on the
condition that Honor should do the same towards morning; and
since she was obviously reluctant when the unwelcome hour
arrived, he smilingly conducted her in person to the
threshold of her room.</p>

<p>"Good-night to you,&mdash;Miss Meredith! Or should it be
good-morning?" he said lightly, in the hope of chasing the
strained look from her face.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>
<p>"Good-morning, for preference," she retorted, with an
attempt at a laugh. "You can take a horse to the water, but
you can't make him drink! I shan't sleep even for five
minutes."</p>

<p>"You think so; but Nature will probably have her way with
you all the same."</p>

<p>He moved as if to go, but she came suddenly nearer; and the
hidden fear leaped to her lips.</p>

<p>"Paul&mdash;is there any real danger because of this fever? One
is so afraid of erysipelas with a wound of that kind; and it
would be&mdash;fatal. Has Dr Mackay said anything definite? Tell
me&mdash;please. I must know the truth."</p>

<p>In the urgency of the moment she laid a light hand upon him;
and Wyndham, bracing the muscles of his arm, tried not to be
aware of her finger-tips through his coat-sleeve.</p>

<p>"You evidently know too much for your own peace of mind," he
said. "But Mackay is as inscrutable as the Sphinx. One could
see he was anxious, because he was ready to snap one's head
off on the least provocation; but beyond that I know no more
than you do. We can only do our poor utmost for him every
hour, you and I, and leave the outcome&mdash;to God."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes,&mdash;you are right. Oh, Paul, what a rock you are at
a bad time like this!"</p>

<p>Unconsciously her fingers tightened upon his arm, and a
thrill like a current of electricity passed through him.
Lifting her hand from its resting-place, he put it aside,
gently but decisively.</p>

<p>"I may be a rock," he remarked with his slow smile, "but I
also happen to be&mdash;a man. Don't make our compact harder for
me than you can help. Good-night again; and sleep
soundly&mdash;for Theo's sake!"</p>

<p>Before she could find words in which to plead forgiveness,
he had almost reached the study door; and she stood
motionless, watching him go, her face aflame with anger at
her own unwitting thoughtlessness, and humiliation at the
exquisite gentleness of his rebuke.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>
<p>Surely there were few men on earth comparable to this man,
whose heart and soul were hers for the taking. A cold fear
came upon her lest in the end she should be driven to
retract her decision; to forego all, and endure all, rather
than withhold from him a happiness he so abundantly
deserved.</p>

<p>"<i>Why</i> is it such a heart-breaking tangle?" she murmured,
locking her hands together till the points of her sapphire
ring cut into the flesh. But she only pressed the harder.
She understood now how it was that monks and fanatics strove
to ease the soul through torments of the flesh. A pang of
physical pain would have been a positive relief just then.
But there was none for her to bear. She was young, vigorous,
radiantly alive. She had not so much as a headache after her
anxious vigil. The high gods had willed that she should feel
and suffer to the full. There is no other pathway to the
ultimate heights.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>
<p>The soft closing of the study door sounded loud in the
stillness; and she went reluctantly into her own room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> say that Owen Kresney was annoyed would be to do him an
injustice. He was furious at the unlooked-for interruption,
which bade fair to cancel all that he had been at such pains
to achieve. Pure spite so mastered him, that even the news
of Desmond's critical condition&mdash;which stirred the whole
station the morning after the funeral&mdash;awakened no spark of
pity in that region of concentrated egotism which must needs
be called his heart.</p>

<p>The "counter-check quarrelsome" would have been welcome
enough. But this impersonal method of knocking the ground
from under his feet goaded him to exasperation. He had not
even the satisfaction of knowing that he had wrought
jealousy or friction between husband and wife. Desmond had
practically ignored his existence. There lay the sting that
roused all the devil in Kresney; and the devil is a light
sleeper in some men's souls. But the Oriental strain in the
man made him an adept at a waiting game; and finding himself
cavalierly thrust aside, he could do no otherwise than
remain in the background for the present, alert, vigilant,
cursing his luck.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>
<p>In the blue bungalow a strained calmness prevailed. The
work that must be done could only be carried through by
living from hour to hour, as Paul had said; and Evelyn could
now no longer be shielded from the pain of knowledge.</p>

<p>On the morning after her first night of vigil, Honor came to
her; and, keeping firm hold of both her hands, told her,
simply and straightly, that the coming week would make the
utmost demands upon her strength and courage.</p>

<p>Evelyn listened with wide eyes and blanching cheeks.</p>

<p>"Did&mdash;did <i>I</i> make him bad?" she asked in an awe-struck
whisper, for she had not been able to keep her own counsel
in regard to her fatal interview with Theo.</p>

<p>"I think not&mdash;I hope not," Honor answered gravely. "But you
did wound him cruelly; and whatever happens, you <i>must</i> not
fail him now."</p>

<p>Evelyn looked up with a distressed puckering of her
forehead.</p>

<p>"I don't want to&mdash;fail him, Honor. But you know I'm not a
bit of use with sick people; and I can't all of a sudden
turn brave and strong, like you."</p>

<p>Honor's smile expressed an infinite deal, but she did not
answer at once. She wanted to be very sure of saying the
right word; and it is only when we try to grapple with
another's intimate need that we find ourselves baffled by
the elusive, intangible spirits of those with whom we share
sunlight and food and the bewildering gift of speech. Honor
was wondering now whether, by a supreme concentration of
will, she could possibly infuse some measure of the soldier
spirit into Theo Desmond's wife; and the extravagant idea
impelled her to a sudden decision.</p>

<p>She drew Evelyn nearer.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, darling," she said. "We have <i>got</i> to pull
Theo through this between us, you and I; and you always say
I can help you to do difficult things. Very well. I am quite
determined that you <i>shall</i> be a brave wife to him, for the
next two weeks at least. And when I make up my mind about a
thing, it is as good as done, isn't it?"</p>

<p>She spoke very low, and her eyes had a misty softness. But
behind the softness lay an invincible assurance, which
Evelyn felt without being able to analyse or understand.</p>

<p>"I don't know how you are going to manage it, Honor," she
murmured. "But I believe you could make <i>any</i>body do
<i>any</i>thing&mdash;especially me!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>
<p>Honor's eyes twinkled at the incoherent compliment. The
visionary moment had passed, and she was her practical self
again, the richer by a fixed resolve.</p>

<p>"At that rate we shall work wonders," she said cheerfully;
"and I promise not to make you do anything alarming. You
shall begin by taking Theo's breakfast to him at once."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The ill news brought Frank Olliver round later in the
morning. She did not stay long; and the look in her eyes as
she parted from Paul in the verandah touched him to the
heart.</p>

<p>"You'll send me word how he goes on, won't you?" she said.
"I'll not be coming round much meself. There's plenty of you
to look after him, and you'll not be needing any help from
me. 'Tis the first time I could say so with truth," she
added, smiling through moist lashes. "An', no doubt, 'tis a
wholesome set-down for me self-conceit!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe you can say it with truth yet," Paul
answered promptly. "I shall get a chance to talk things over
with Honor this morning, and you shall hear the result. May
I invite myself to tea, please?"</p>

<p>"Ah, God bless you, Major Wyndham!" she exclaimed, with
something of her natural heartiness. "It's a pity there's
not more o' your sort in the world."</p>

<p>A compliment, even from Mrs Olliver, invariably struck Paul
dumb; and before any answer occurred to him she had cantered
away.</p>

<p>The first time he could secure a few minutes alone with
Honor he put in an urgent plea for Mrs Olliver's services,
and had the satisfaction of going round to her bungalow at
tea-time, armed with a special request from the girl
herself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>
<p>Evelyn accepted, with a slight lift of her brows, Honor's
announcement that Mrs Olliver would be only too glad to help
in nursing Theo. These odd people, who seemed to enjoy long
nights of watching, the uncanny mutterings of delirium, and
the incessant doling out of food and medicine, puzzled her
beyond measure. She had a hazy idea that she ought to enjoy
it in the same way, and a very clear knowledge that she did
no such thing. She regarded it as a sort of penance, imposed
by Honor, not altogether unfairly. She had just conscience
enough to recognise that. And as the hushed monotone of
nights and days dragged by, with little relief from the dead
weight of anxiety, it did indeed seem as if Honor had
succeeded in willing a portion of her brave spirit into her
friend. What had passed in secret between God and her own
soul resulted in a breaking down of the bounds of self&mdash;an
unconscious spiritual bestowal of the best that was in her,
with that splendid lack of economy in giving which is the
hall-mark of a great nature. And Evelyn took colour from the
new atmosphere enveloping her with the curious readiness of
her type.</p>

<p>Desmond himself, in moments of wakefulness, or passing
freedom from delirium, was surprised and profoundly moved to
find his wife constantly in attendance on him. At the time
he was too ill to express his appreciation. But a vision of
her dwelt continually in his mind; and the frequency of her
name on his lips brought tears of real self-reproach to her
eyes as she sat alone with him through the dread small
hours, not daring to glance into the darkest corners or to
stir unless necessity compelled her; overpowered by those
vague terrors that evaporate like mist in the cold light of
definition.</p>

<p>In this fashion an interminable week slipped past, bringing
the patient to that critical "corner" with which too many of
us are familiar. Neither Paul nor Mackay left the study for
twenty-four hours; while the women sat with folded hands and
waited&mdash;a more arduous task than it sounds.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>
<p>With the coming of morning, and of the first hopeful word
from the sick-room, an audible sigh of relief seemed to pass
through the house and compound. It was as if they had all
been holding their breath till the worst was over. It became
possible at last to achieve smiles that were not mere
dutiful distortions of the lips. James Mackay grew one
degree less irritable; Wyndham one degree less monosyllabic;
Amar Singh condescended to arise and resume his neglected
duties; while Rob&mdash;becoming aware, in his own fashion, of a
stir in the air&mdash;emerged from his basket, and shook himself
with such energy and thoroughness that Mackay whisked him
unceremoniously into the hall, where he sat nursing his
injured dignity, quietly determined to slip back, on the
first chance, into the room that was his by right, though
temporarily in the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>It was some five days later that Desmond, waking towards
morning, found his wife standing beside him in expectant
watchfulness.</p>

<p>The low camp-bed lent her a fictitious air of height, as did
also the unbroken line of her blue dressing-gown, with its
cloud of misty whiteness at the throat. A shaded lamp in a
far corner clashed with the first glimmer of dawn; and in
the dimness Evelyn's face showed pale and indistinct, save
for two dusky semicircles where her lashes rested on her
cheek. Desmond saw all this, because at night the shade was
discarded, though the rakish bandage still eclipsed his
right eye. He lay lapped in a pleasant sense of the
unreality of outward things, and his wife&mdash;dimly seen and
motionless&mdash;had the air of a dream-figure in a dream.</p>

<p>Suddenly she leaned down, and caressed his damp hair with a
familiar lightness of touch.</p>

<p>"I heard you move, darling," she whispered. "I've been
sitting such a long, long while alone; and I badly wanted
you to wake up."</p>

<p>"Such a brave Ladybird!" he said, imprisoning her fingers.
"You seem to be on duty all the time. They haven't been
letting you do too much, have they?"</p>

<p>"Oh no; I'm not clever enough to do much," she answered, a
little wistfully. "It is Honor who really does everything."</p>

<p>Desmond frowned. Mention of Honor effectually dispelled the
dream. "I choose to believe that everything <i>isn't</i> her
doing," he said with unnecessary emphasis.</p>

<p>But for once Evelyn was disposed to extol Honor at her own
expense. She had been lifted, for the time being, higher
than she knew.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>
<p>"It <i>is</i>, Theo&mdash;truly," she persisted, perching lightly on
the edge of the bed, though she had been reminded half a
dozen times that the "patient's" bed must not be treated as
a chair. "I don't know anything about nursing people. Honor
just told me that I was going to do it beautifully, that I
wasn't really frightened or stupid at all; and somehow, she
has made it all come true. She's been ever so kind and
patient; and I'm not half so nervous now when I'm left alone
all night. She writes out every little thing I have to do,
and sits up herself in her own room. She's sitting there
now, reading or writing, so I can go to her any minute if I
really want help. She knows it comforts me to feel there's
some one else awake; and she does her own nights of nursing
just the same. I often wonder how she stands it all."</p>

<p>Desmond drew in his breath with a sharp sound. The
infinitely much that he owed to this girl, at every turn,
threatened to become a torment beyond endurance.</p>

<p>Evelyn caught the sound and misunderstood it.</p>

<p>"There now, I'm tiring you, talking too much. I'm sure you
ought to be having something or another, even though you are
better."</p>

<p>She consulted her paper; and returning with the
medicine-glass half filled, held it to his lips, raising his
head with one hand. But at the first sip he jerked it back
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Tastes queer. Are you sure it's the right stuff?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Of course."</p>

<p>"Better look and see."</p>

<p>She took up the bottle, and examined it close to the light.
There was an ominous silence.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked in pure amusement.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it was the&mdash;lotion for your eyes!"</p>

<p>The last words came out in a desperate rush, and there was
tragedy in her tone. But Desmond laughed as he had not
laughed since his parting with the Boy.</p>

<p>"Come on, then, and square the account by doctoring my eyes
with the medicine."</p>

<p>"Oh, Theo, don't! It isn't a joke!"</p>

<p>"It is, if I choose to take it so, you dear, foolish little
woman!"</p>

<p>She handed him the refilled glass; then, to his surprise,
collapsed beside the bed and burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Ladybird, what nonsense!" he rebuked her gently, laying a
hand on her head.</p>

<p>"It's not nonsense. It's horrible to be useless
and&mdash;idiotic, however hard you try. It might easily have
been&mdash;poison, and I might have&mdash;killed you!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>
<p>"<i>Only</i> it wasn't&mdash;<i>and</i> you didn't!" he retorted, smiling.
"You're upset, and worn out from want of sleep; that's all."</p>

<p>She made a determined effort to swallow down her sobs, and
knelt upright with clasped hands.</p>

<p>"No, Theo, I'm not worn out; I'm simply stupid. And you're
the kindest man that ever lived. But I mustn't cry any more,
or you'll get ill again, and then Honor will be really
angry!"</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up about Honor!" he broke out irritably; and set
his teeth directly the words were spoken.</p>

<p>Evelyn started. "I won't shut up about Honor! I love her,
and you're very ungrateful not to love her too, when she's
been so good to you."</p>

<p>She spoke almost angrily, and he made haste to rectify his
slip.</p>

<p>"No. I'm not ungrateful. I&mdash;love her right enough."</p>

<p>He thought the statement would have choked him. But Evelyn
noticed nothing, and for a while neither spoke.</p>

<p>"Look here, Ladybird," he said suddenly, "I can't have you
calling yourself names as you did just now. You only get
these notions into your small head because I have condemned
you to a life that makes demands on you beyond your
strength. I ought to have seen from the start that it was a
case of choosing between the Frontier and you. At all
events, I see it clearly now; and&mdash;it's not too late. One
can always exchange into a down-country regiment, you know.
Or I have interest enough to get a Staff appointment
somewhere&mdash;Simla, perhaps. How would that suit you?"</p>

<p>The suggestion took away her breath.</p>

<p>"You don't <i>mean</i> that, Theo&mdash;seriously?" she gasped; and
the repressed eagerness in her tone sounded the death-knell
of his dearest ambitions.</p>

<p>"I was never more serious in my life," he answered steadily.</p>

<p>"You would leave the Frontier&mdash;the regiment&mdash;and never come
back?"</p>

<p>"You have only to say the word, and as soon as I am on my
feet again I'll see what can be done."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>
<p>But the word was not forthcoming; and in her changed
position he could see nothing of her face but its oval
outline of cheek and chin. He waited; holding his breath.
Then, at last, she spoke.</p>

<p>"No, Theo. It wouldn't be fair. You belong to the Frontier.
Every one says so. And&mdash;I shall get used to it in time."</p>

<p>She spoke mechanically, without turning her head; and
Desmond's arm went round her on the instant.</p>

<p>"But you haven't got to think of me," he urged. "I want to
do what will make you happy. That's all."</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it wouldn't make me happy. And, please, don't talk
about it any more."</p>

<p>At that he drew her down to him.</p>

<p>"God bless you, my darling!" he whispered. But even in
speaking he knew that he could not accept her sacrifice;
that her courage&mdash;barely equal to the verbal
renunciation&mdash;would be crushed to powder in the crucible of
days and years. For the moment, however, it seemed best to
drop the subject, since nothing definite could be done
without Honor's consent.</p>

<p>"Now I ought to be attending to my business!" she said,
freeing herself with a little nervous laugh. "It's getting
too light. I must put out the lamp and dress you up in your
shade again, you poor, patient Theo. Then we'll have <i>chota
hazri</i> together."</p>

<p>She moved away from him quickly, and not quite steadily. She
had let slip her one chance of escape, and she did not know
why she had done it. The impulse to refuse had been
unreasoning, overpowering; and now it was all over she only
knew that she had done what Honor would approve, and what
she herself would regret to the end of her life. How far the
girl whose soul had been concentrated on Evelyn's uplifting
was responsible for her flash of self-sacrifice, is a
problem that must be left for psychologists to solve.</p>

<p>Desmond had only one thought in his brain that morning&mdash;"How
in the world am I going to tackle Honor?" He foresaw a
pitched battle, ending in possible defeat; and decided to
defer it till he felt more physically fit for the strain.
For he possessed the rapid recuperative power of his type;
and, the fever once conquered, each day added a cubit to his
returning vigour.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>
<p>One night, towards the close of the second week of his
illness, he awoke suddenly from dreamless sleep to alert
wakefulness, a sense of renewed health and power thrilling
through his veins. He passed a hand across his forehead and
eyes, for the pure pleasure of realising their freedom from
the disfiguring bandage, and glanced toward the
writing-table, whence the too familiar screened lamp flung
ghostly lights and shadows up among the bare rafters twenty
feet above.</p>

<p>It was Honor who sat beside it now, in a loose white
wrapper, her head resting on her hand, an open book before
her. The light fell full upon her profile, emphasising its
nobility of outline&mdash;the short straight nose, the exquisite
moulding of mouth and chin; while all about her shoulders
fell the burnished mantle of her hair.</p>

<p>For many moments Desmond lay very still. This amazing girl,
in the fulness of her beauty, and in her superb
unconsciousness of its effect upon himself, had him at a
disadvantage; and he knew it. The disadvantage was only
increased by waiting and watching; and at last he spoke,
scarcely above his breath.</p>

<p>"Honor&mdash;I am awake."</p>

<p>She started, and instinctively her hand went to her hair,
gathering it deftly together. But he made haste to
interpose.</p>

<p>"Please leave it alone!"</p>

<p>His tone had in it more of fervour than he knew, and she
dropped the heavy mass hastily, thankful to screen her face
from view. Then, because silence had in it an element of
danger, she forced herself to break it.</p>

<p>"You were sleeping so soundly that I thought you were safe
not to wake till morning; and it was a relief to let it
down."</p>

<p>"Why apologise?" he asked, smiling. "What is it you are
reading? Won't you share it with me? I feel hopelessly
wide-awake."</p>

<p>"It would be delightful to read to you again," she said
simply. "But you might prefer something lighter. I was
reading&mdash;a sermon."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>
<p>"I have no prejudice against sermons. We get few enough up
here. What's your subject?"</p>

<p>"The Responsibility of Strength."</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;" There was pain in the low sound. "<i>You</i> must know a
good deal about that form of responsibility,&mdash;you who are so
superbly strong." And again she was grateful for her
sheltering veil of hair. "The text is from Romans, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes. 'We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities
of the weak.'"</p>

<p>"It's a heavy penalty," he mused. "But one is bound to pay
it to the uttermost farthing. Isn't that so?"</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;to the uttermost farthing."</p>

<p>She was thinking of herself, and his answer amazed her.</p>

<p>"Then, let me off that promise I gave you last April. It was
a fatal mistake, and it's not fair on Ladybird."</p>

<p>She stifled an exclamation of dismay. It had been one thing
to plead with him a year ago; but now it seemed impossible
to speak a dozen words on the subject without risk of
self-betrayal.</p>

<p>Her silence pricked Desmond to impatience.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "what's the difficulty? You'll do what I
ask, of course?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't. It is out of the question."</p>

<p>A suppressed sound of vexation reached her.</p>

<p>"I thought you cared more for Evelyn than that amounts to,"
he said reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I <i>do</i> care for her. You know I do."</p>

<p>"Yet you intend to hold out against me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"In spite of all it may involve&mdash;for Ladybird?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The brief finality of her answers was curiously
discouraging, and for the moment Desmond could think of
nothing more to say.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes to concentrate thought and shut out the
distracting vision of her bowed head. When he opened them
again she was standing close to him&mdash;a white commanding
figure, in a dusky cloak of hair reaching almost to her
knees.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>
<p>"Theo," she said softly, with an eloquent gesture of
appeal, "you don't know how it hurts me to seem hard and
unfeeling about Ladybird, when I understand so much too well
the spirit that is prompting you to do this thing. I frankly
confess you are right from your point of view. But there
remains my point of view; and so long as I have the right to
prevent it, you shall not spoil your life and hers."</p>

<p>Desmond would have been more, or less, than man if he could
have heard her unmoved; and as he lay looking up at her he
was tempted beyond measure to take possession of those
appealing hands, to draw her down to him, and thank her from
his heart for her brave words. But he merely shifted
uneasily.</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand you, Honor," he said slowly. "It
is strange that you should&mdash;care so much about what I do
with my life."</p>

<p>The words startled her, yet she met them without flinching.</p>

<p>"Is it? I think it would be far more strange if I had lived
with you for a year without learning&mdash;to care. That is why I
can never say 'Yes' to your request."</p>

<p>"And I am determined that you shall say 'Yes' to it in the
end."</p>

<p>The note of immobility in his low voice made her feel
powerless to resist him; but she steeled herself against the
sensation by main force of will.</p>

<p>"At least I can forbid any further mention of it till you
are fitter to cope with such a disturbing subject. Are you
aware that it's only two o'clock? And you need sleep more
than anything else just now. I'll give you some beef-jelly,
and sit in my own room for an hour, or I believe you will
never go off again at all."</p>

<p>But when she returned at the end of an hour she found him
still awake.</p>

<p>"Honor,"&mdash;he began; but she checked him with smiling
decision. "Not another word to-night, Theo, or I must go
altogether."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>
<p>The threat was more compelling than she knew; and sitting
down by the table, she took up her vigil as before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Certain</span> souls, like certain bodies, cannot breathe for long
at a stretch the rarefied atmosphere of the heights; and
towards the end of the second week Evelyn's zeal began to
wear thin. Dr Mackay had at last spoken hopefully as to the
fate of Desmond's eyes. Night-nursing was no longer a
necessity; and with the relief from anxiety, from the effort
to meet the demands upon her small stock of strength, came
the inevitable drop to the comfortable commonplaces of
everyday life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>
<p>Nor was she alone in her sensations. In varying degrees
they affected every inmate of the blue bungalow during that
last week of Desmond's imprisonment; and it is probable that
Honor unconsciously relaxed her mental concentration upon
Evelyn which had been responsible for more than either knew.
Her midnight talk with Desmond, and the knowledge that a
second contest lay before her, gave her food for much
troubled reflection; while the comparative lightness of
sick-room duties left her free to grapple with arrears of
letters, work, and household accounts. Thus, being only
human, and very much absorbed in matters practical, she made
the fatal mistake of relaxing her vigilance at the very
moment when Evelyn needed it most. But it is written that
"no man may redeem his brother"; and, soon or late the
relapse must have come. Honor could not hope to lay
permanent hold upon the volatile spirit of her friend.</p>

<p>Desmond himself, whose patience under the burden of illness
and of a nerve-shattering fear had amazed even those who
knew him best, was approaching the irritable stage of
convalescence,&mdash;the strong man's rebellion against Nature's
unhurried methods; against enforced restriction and
imprisonment, when renewed life is pulsing through every
artery, renewed vigour stirring the reawakened brain.</p>

<p>Nor were matters enlivened by Mackay's decree that, if risk
were to be avoided, the detested shade must be worn for
three full weeks or a month. Thus to imprisonment was added
the gall and wormwood of total dependence upon others; the
unthinkable prospect of parting with Paul, with the Border
itself&mdash;with everything that had hitherto made life worth
living; and, worse than all, the undercurrent of striving to
ignore that veiled danger, which he refused to name, even in
his thoughts, and which lay like a millstone upon his heart.</p>

<p>Thus there were inevitable moments when his spirit kicked
against the pricks; when his return to life and health
seemed a parody of a blessing, a husk emptied of the
life-giving grain. In these moods Evelyn found herself
powerless to cope with him; and was not a little aggrieved
when she discovered that his unvarying need, on black days,
was the companionship of Paul Wyndham, whose insight
detected some hidden trouble, and who, as a matter of
course, devoted every spare moment to his friend.</p>

<p>One thing Desmond missed beyond all else&mdash;the sound of music
in the house. Since the terrible evening of his home-coming,
the piano had not been opened; and his recent experience of
the effect Honor's music could produce on him made him chary
of asking her to play.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>
<p>He saw very little of her in these days. Now and then she
would come and read to him; but their former open-hearted
intercourse seemed irrevocably a thing of the past. With the
return of the troops, however, interests multiplied.
Desmond's hold on the hearts of all who knew him had seldom
been so practically proven; and the man was moved beyond
measure at that which he could not fail to perceive. His
small study was rarely empty, and often overcrowded with
men&mdash;Sikhs, Gunners, Sappers, and, above all, his own
brother officers, who filled the place with tobacco-smoke,
the cheerful clink of ice against long tumblers, and
frequent explosions of deep-chested laughter; while Desmond
threw himself whole-heartedly into the good minute and
enjoyed it to the full.</p>

<p>To Evelyn this new state of things was a little
disconcerting. During Theo's illness she, as his wife, had
enjoyed special attention and consideration; and since her
incomprehensible refusal of his offer to throw up the
Frontier, had even regarded herself as something of a
heroine, if an unwilling one. Now, all of a sudden, she felt
deserted, unimportant, and more or less "out of it all." The
past fortnight seemed an uplifted dream, from which she had
awakened to find herself sitting among the dust and stones
of prose and hard facts. Yet she could not complain
definitely of anything or any one. Honor and Theo were kind
and tender, as always; but the one was temporarily busy, and
the other very naturally enjoying a reversion to masculine
society. Nobody seemed to want her. There seemed no
particular use for her any more.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the whole station wore a subdued air.
The Club compound was practically deserted; and Evelyn's
first outing in that direction left her with no desire to
repeat the experiment for the present. The Sikhs had lost a
popular captain; while a Gunner subaltern, who had returned
seriously wounded, was being nursed by Mrs Conolly and the
only woman in the battery.</p>

<p>This sort of thing was, as Theo had said, "part and parcel"
of life on the Frontier; it was to this that she had
condemned herself for the next twenty years at least; by
which time she supposed she would be far too old to care for
the frivolities of life at all! If only Theo would be
generous and give her a second chance, she would not let it
slip this time&mdash;she would not indeed!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>
<p>Altogether the aspect of things in general was sufficiently
depressing. Then one afternoon she met Owen Kresney; and all
at once life seemed to take on a new complexion. Here, at
least, was some one who wanted her, when every one else
seemed only to want Theo; some one who was really glad to
see her&mdash;rather too emphatically glad, perhaps; but the
eagerness of his greeting flattered her, and she had
overlooked the rest. She had been returning in her jhampan
from her melancholy outing to the Club, when he had caught
sight of her in the distance, and cantering up to her side,
had dismounted, and shaken hands as though they had not met
for a year.</p>

<p>"How awfully white and pulled down you look!" he had said
with low-toned sympathy. "They must have been working you
too hard. They forget that you are not a strapping woman
like Miss Meredith."</p>

<p>"No one has worked me too hard," she answered, flushing at
the veiled implication against her husband. "I wanted to do
as much as the others."</p>

<p>"Of course you did. But you are too delicate to work like
that, and it isn't fair to take advantage of your
unselfishness. I hope you're going off to the Hills very
soon, now that Desmond is better?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I hope so too."</p>

<p>Her voice had an unconscious weariness, and he bent a little
closer, scanning her face with a concern that bordered on
tenderness. "We have thought of you a great deal these two
weeks, Mrs Desmond," he said. "We hardly cared to go out to
tennis, or anything, while you were in such trouble. But now
it has all come out right, you must be dreadfully in want of
cheering up. Won't you come home with me and have a talk,
like old times? Linda would be awfully pleased to see you
again."</p>

<p>The temptation was irresistible. It emphasised her vague
sense of loneliness, of being left out in the cold. The
longing to be comforted and made much of was strong upon
her.</p>

<p>"It is very nice of you to want me," she had said, as simply
as a child. To which he had replied with prompt, if somewhat
cheap, gallantry that no one could possibly help wanting
her; and his reward had been a flush, as delicate in tint as
the inner surface of a shell. This man had one strong point
in his favour&mdash;he invariably talked to her about herself; a
trick Desmond had never learnt, nor ever would.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>
<p>She had spent more than an hour in Miss Kresney's stuffy,
dusty drawing-room, and had left it with a pleasantly
revived sense of her own importance; had left Kresney
himself in a state of carefully repressed triumph; for she
had promised him an early morning ride in two days' time.</p>

<p>It was all harmless enough so far as she was
concerned&mdash;merely a case of flattered vanity and idle hands.
But the strong nature, the large purpose, lies eternally at
the mercy of life's little things.</p>

<p>She said nothing to Honor or Theo of her meeting with
Kresney, or of the coming ride. A fortnight of submission to
the former had evoked a passing gleam of independence. They
would probably make a fuss; and since they neither of them
needed her, she was surely at liberty to amuse herself as
she pleased.</p>

<p>On her return a buzz of deep voices greeted her from the
study, and it transpired that Honor had gone over to Mrs
Conolly's. Thus she had leisure before dinner to argue the
matter out in her mind to her own complete justification. If
Mr Kresney chose to be polite to her, why should she rebuff
him and hurt his feelings, just because Theo had some stupid
prejudice against him? On the other hand, where was the use
of vexing Theo, when every one was doing their best to
shield him from needless irritation? As soon as his eyes
were right they would go to the Hills together. She would
have him all to herself; and Kresney sank into immediate
insignificance at the thought.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the man's assiduity and thinly veiled admiration
formed a welcome relief in a desert of dulness. Besides, one
was bound to be pleasant to a man when one practically owed
him two hundred rupees.</p>

<p>Unwittingly she shelved the fact that Kresney was beginning
to exercise a disturbing fascination over her; that the
insistence underlying his humility alternately pleased and
frightened her; the lurking fear of what he might say next
gave a distinct flavour of excitement to their every
meeting.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>
<p>The slippery path that lies between truth and direct
falsehood had always been fatally easy for her to follow;
and she followed it now more from natural instinct, and from
the child's dread of making people "cross," than from any
deliberate intent to deceive. It was so much easier to say
nothing. Therefore she said nothing; and left the future to
look after itself.</p>

<p>On returning from her first ride with Kresney, she found
Honor in the verandah giving orders to a sais. The girl
lifted her out of the saddle, and kissed her on both cheeks.</p>

<p>"Such a very early Ladybird!" she said, laughing. "You might
have let me come too."</p>

<p>Accordingly they went out together the next morning, but on
future occasions Evelyn returned more cautiously, and
changed her habit before appearing at the breakfast-table.
She went out once or twice in the afternoons also, and
Honor's thoughts flew to the Kresneys as a matter of course;
but remembering a certain incident at Murree, she held her
peace. She was disheartened, and very far from satisfied,
nevertheless.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In this fashion ten days slipped uneventfully past. Then, on
a certain afternoon, Kresney again met Evelyn by
chance,&mdash;and begged her to come back with him to tea before
going home. Her consent was a foregone conclusion; and as
they neared Kresney's whitewashed gate-posts, Captain
Olliver trotted past. He had already met Miss Kresney
jogging out to tea on a long-tailed pony of uncertain age;
and glancing casually back over his shoulder, he saw Mrs
Desmond's jhampan entering the gateway. Whereat he swore
vigorously under his breath, and urged his pony to a brisker
pace.</p>

<p>But of these facts Evelyn was blissfully unaware. Her
uppermost thought was a happy consciousness of looking her
best. From the forget-me-nots in her hat to the last frill
of her India muslin gown all was blue&mdash;the fragile blue of
the far horizon at dawn. And Kresney had an eye for such
things.</p>

<p>She started slightly on discovering that the drawing-room
was empty.</p>

<p>"Where's Miss Kresney?" she asked, stopping dead upon the
threshold.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why, what a fool I am!" the man exclaimed with a
creditable air of frankness. "I clean forgot she had gone
out to tea. But you're not going to desert me on that
account! You wouldn't be so unkind!"</p>

<p>Evelyn felt herself trapped. It would seem foolish and
pointed to go; yet she had sense enough to know that it
would be very unwise to stay. She compromised matters by
saying sweetly that she would come in just for ten minutes,
to have a cup of tea before going back in the sun.</p>

<p>Kresney looked his gratification&mdash;looked it so eloquently
that she lowered her eyes, and went forwards hurriedly, as
if fearing that something more definite might follow the
look.</p>

<p>But the man, though inwardly exultant, was well on his
guard. If he startled her this first time, he could not hope
to repeat the experiment. He chose the most comfortable
chair for her; insisted on an elaborate arrangement of
cushions at her back; poured out her tea; and plied her
assiduously with stale sponge-cake and mixed biscuits. Then
drawing up his own chair very close, he settled himself to
the congenial task of amusing and flattering her, with such
success that her ten minutes had stretched to an hour before
she even thought of rising to go.</p>

<p>Captain Olliver, meanwhile, had ridden on to the blue
bungalow, which chanced to be his destination; and had spent
half an hour in desultory talk with Desmond, Wyndham, and
the Colonel, who had fallen into a habit of dropping in
almost daily.</p>

<p>As he rose to take his leave, a glance at Wyndham brought
the latter out into the hall with him.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked. "Want to speak to me about
something?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Can we have a few words alone anywhere? It concerns
Desmond, and I can't speak to him myself."</p>

<p>Paul frowned.</p>

<p>"Nothing serious, I hope. Come in here a minute." And he led
the way into his own Spartan-looking room.</p>

<p>"Now let me hear it," he said quietly.</p>

<p>But Olliver balanced himself on the edge of the table,
tapped his pipe against it, and loosened the contents
scientifically with his penknife before complying with the
request.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>
<p>"The truth is," he began at length, "that it's about Mrs
Desmond and that confounded cad Kresney."</p>

<p>"Ah!" The note of pain in Wyndham's voice made the other
look at him questioningly.</p>

<p>"You've noticed it, then?"</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;it was rather marked while Desmond was away. Nothing
to trouble about, though, if it had been any other man than
Kresney."</p>

<p>Olliver brought his fist down on the table.</p>

<p>"That's precisely what my wife says. You know what a lot she
thinks of Desmond; and I believe she's capable of tackling
the little woman herself, which I couldn't stand at any
price. That's why I promised to speak to you to-day. Hope it
doesn't seem infernal cheek on my part."</p>

<p>"Not at all. Go on."</p>

<p>Each instinctively avoided the other's eyes; while Olliver,
in a few curt sentences, spoke his mind on the subject in
hand.</p>

<p>The bond that links the inhabitants of small isolated Indian
stations is a thing that only the Anglo-Indian can quite
understand. Desmond's illness, and the possible tragedy
overhanging him, had roused such strong feeling in Kohat,
that his wife's conduct&mdash;which at another time would merely
have supplied material for a little mild gossip&mdash;had
awakened the general sense of indignation, more especially
among the men. But men are not free of speech on these
matters, and it was certain pungent remarks made by little
Mrs Riley of the Sikhs which had set Frank Olliver's Irish
temper in a blaze. The recollection of what she had seen
during Desmond's absence still rankled in her mind; and her
husband, with a masculine dread of an open quarrel between
the only two ladies in the Regiment, had accepted the lesser
evil of speaking to Wyndham himself.</p>

<p>"Mind, I give Mrs Desmond credit for being more passive than
active in the whole affair," he concluded, since Paul seemed
disinclined to volunteer a remark. "But the deuce of it is,
that I feel sure Desmond knows less about the thing than any
one else. Can you see him putting up with it under any
circumstances?"</p>

<p>Wyndham shook his head; and for a while they smoked in
silence thinking their own thoughts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>
<p>"You want me," Paul asked at length, "to pass all this on
to Desmond? Is that it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that's it. Unless you think he knows it already."</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;frankly, I don't. But is it our business to enlighten
him?"</p>

<p>"That's a ticklish question. But I'm inclined to think it
is. We can't be expected to stand a bounder like Kresney
hanging round one of our ladies. Why, I met him as I came
here, taking her into his bungalow; and I had only just
passed the sister on that old patriarch she rides. I call
that going a bit too far; and I fancy Desmond would agree
with me."</p>

<p>Wyndham looked up decisively.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't repeat <i>that</i> to him, if my life depended on
it."</p>

<p>"No, no. Of course not. You can make things clear without
saying too much. Beastly unpleasant job, and I'm sorry to be
forcing it on you. But you must know that you're the only
chap in the Regiment who could dream of speaking two words
to Desmond on such a delicate subject."</p>

<p>Paul acknowledged the statement with a wry smile under his
moustache.</p>

<p>"I doubt if he will stand it, even from me; and I'd a deal
sooner wring Kresney's neck. But I'll do the best I can, and
take my chance of the consequences to myself."</p>

<p>Thus reassured, Olliver departed, and Wyndham, watching him
go, wondered what he intended to say.</p>

<p>There are few things more distasteful to a well-bred man
than the necessity of speaking to a friend, however
intimate, on the subject of his wife's conduct or character;
because there are few things a man respects more intimately
than his fellow-man's reserve. Wyndham knew, moreover, that
the real sting of his communication would lie less in the
facts themselves than in Mrs Desmond's probable concealment
of them; and his natural kindliness prompted him to a
passing pity for Evelyn, who, in all likelihood, had not yet
penetrated beyond the outer shell of her husband's strongly
marked character.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>
<p>The only means of tempering the wind to the shorn lamb lay
in speaking first to Honor; and on that idea Wyndham
unconditionally turned his back. Mrs Desmond had brought
this thing upon herself. She must face the consequences as
best she might.</p>

<p>But on entering the study, the words he had come to say were
checked upon his lips.</p>

<p>Desmond stood beside the writing-table, where the green
shade lay discarded; and a noticeable scar on his right
cheek was all that now remained of the wound which had
threatened such serious results. His whole attention was
centred upon Rob, who pranced at his feet with ungainly
caperings, flinging dignity to the winds, and testifying,
with heart and voice and eloquent tail, to the joy that was
in him.</p>

<p>Paul's sensitive soul revolted from the necessity of
imparting ill news at such a moment; and it was Desmond who
spoke first.</p>

<p>"Mackay's been here this minute making a final examination
of my eyes. Gave me leave, thank God, to discard <i>that</i>
abomination; and Rob hasn't left off congratulating me since
I flung it on the table. The little beggar seems to
understand what's happened just as well as I do." He turned
on Wyndham with a short satisfied laugh. "By Jove, Paul,
it's thundering good to look <i>you</i> squarely in the face
again! But why,&mdash;what's the trouble, old man? Have you heard
bad news?"</p>

<p>"Not very bad, but certainly&mdash;unpleasant."</p>

<p>"And you came to tell me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I came to tell you."</p>

<p>Desmond motioned him to a chair; and, as he seated himself
with unhurried deliberation, laid a sympathetic hand on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked. "The Regiment or yourself?"</p>

<p>"Neither."</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"It concerns <i>you</i>, my dear Theo," Paul answered slowly.
"And it is about&mdash;your wife."</p>

<p>Desmond frowned sharply, and Wyndham saw the defensive look
spring into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you mean&mdash;&mdash;? Has there been an accident?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no; nothing of that sort. I'm sorry to have been so
clumsy."</p>

<p>"She is quite safe? Nothing wrong with her?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>
<p>Desmond's mouth took an expression Wyndham knew well. An
enemy might have called it pig-headed.</p>

<p>"At that rate, there can be no more to say about her."</p>

<p>And he went leisurely over to the mantelpiece, where he
remained, leaning on one elbow, his back towards his
companion. Paul saw plainly that he was ill at ease, and
cursed the contingency which compelled him to further
speech.</p>

<p>"Forgive me if I seem intrusive, Theo," he began, "but I am
afraid there is more to be said. This afternoon Olliver
spoke to me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Desmond swung round again, with blazing eyes.</p>

<p>"What the hell has Olliver got to do with <i>my wife</i>? I have
never interfered with his."</p>

<p>Paul Wyndham looked very steadily into the disturbed face of
his friend. Then he brought his hand down on the green baize
of the table before him.</p>

<p>"Theo&mdash;my dear fellow," he said, "it is hard enough for me,
in any case, to say what I must. Is it quite generous of you
to make it harder?"</p>

<p>The fire died slowly out of Desmond's eyes, giving place to
a look of stubborn resignation.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Paul. Sorry I lost my temper. Let me have the
bare facts, please. Though I probably know them already."</p>

<p>And he returned to his former attitude, the fingers of his
left hand caressing mechanically the stem of a tall vase.</p>

<p>His last remark made Paul watch him anxiously. He was
wondering whether Theo's determination to shield his wife
would possibly goad him into a direct lie; and he devoutly
hoped not.</p>

<p>"Well," he began at length, "Olliver spoke to me because
there seems to be rather a strong feeling in the Regiment
about Mrs Desmond and&mdash;Kresney being so constantly together
again just now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The vase Desmond was handling fell with a crash on the
concrete hearth, and the blood spurted from a surface cut on
his finger. But beyond thrusting the scarred hand into his
coat pocket, he made no movement.</p>

<p>"Go on," he said doggedly; and Paul obediently went on,
addressing his unresponsive back and shoulders.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>
<p>"You see, it was rather&mdash;noticeable while you were away.
Perhaps the fact that we all dislike Kresney made it more
so; and it naturally strikes one as very bad taste on his
part to be forcing himself on your wife at a time like this.
It seems there was some slight talk at the Club too&mdash;not
worth noticing, of course. But you know Mrs Olliver takes
fire easily, where any of us are concerned; and Olliver
seemed afraid she might speak to Mrs Desmond, unless I came
to you. He met them again this afternoon; and he felt you
ought at least to know exactly how matters stand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He might have taken it for granted that I should do that
without <i>his</i> interference."</p>

<p>Desmond's temper was flaring up again; and his words brought
the anxious look back to Paul's eyes. Theo was sailing very
near the wind.</p>

<p>"We all know you too well to believe that you
would&mdash;tolerate such a state of things&mdash;<i>if</i> you were aware
of them," he answered slowly, choosing his words with care.
"Please understand, Theo, that it is Kresney who is
criticised; and that Olliver put the whole thing before me
as nicely as possible. I feel I have been clumsy enough
myself. But it goes against the grain to say anything at
all, you understand?"</p>

<p>Desmond's sole answer was a decisive nod of the head. Then
silence fell&mdash;a strained silence, difficult to break. Yet it
was he himself who broke it.</p>

<p>"I can do no less than thank you," he said stiffly. "It was
a hateful thing to have thrust upon you; but Frank's
intrusion would have been unendurable. The truth is&mdash;" he
paused, for the words were hard to bring out&mdash;"I have
known&mdash;all along that my wife was more friendly with&mdash;these
Kresneys than I quite cared about. One could make no valid
objections without seeming uncharitable, and she is still
too new here to understand our point of view. But I must see
to it now that she <i>shall</i> understand, once and for all. It
is intolerable to have one's brother officers&mdash;making
remarks, even with the best intentions. Will you ask Honor
to tell my wife, when she comes in, that I want to see her?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>
<p>Silence again; and Paul rose to his feet. It hurt him to
leave his friend without a word. But the attitude Desmond
had adopted precluded the lightest touch of sympathy, and
Wyndham could not choose but admire him the more.</p>

<p>"By the way"&mdash;Desmond turned upon him as he went with
startling abruptness&mdash;"<i>Honor</i> isn't in any way mixed up
with all this, is she?"</p>

<p>Something in his look and tone made Wyndham glance at him
intently before replying. "Of course she saw how things were
while you were away. But she has been out very little
lately; and as far as I can judge, she knows nothing about
the talk that is going on now."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!" Desmond muttered into his moustache; but
Paul's ear failed to catch the words.</p>

<p>"Won't you have a 'peg' or a cup of tea, Theo?" he asked
gently.</p>

<p>"No, thanks."</p>

<p>"I think you ought to have one or the other."</p>

<p>"Very well, whichever you please. Only, bring it yourself,
there's a good chap."</p>

<p>Paul's eyes rested thoughtfully upon his friend, who,
absorbed in his own reflections, seemed to have forgotten
his presence. Then he went slowly away, revolving the matter
in his mind.</p>

<p>While avoiding the least shadow of false statement, Desmond
had succeeded in shielding his wife from the one serious
implication suggested by her conduct, or at least would have
so succeeded, but for the tell-tale crash of glass upon the
hearth-stone. Yet the most vivid impression left on Paul by
their short interview was the look in Theo's eyes when he
had asked that one abrupt question about Honor Meredith.</p>

<p>Was it possible&mdash;&mdash;? Was it even remotely possible&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>
<p>Wyndham reined in the involuntary thought, as a man reins
in his horse on the brink of a precipice. Common loyalty to
the friend he loved, with the unspoken love of half a
lifetime, forbade him to look that shrouded possibility
frankly in the face.</p>

<h4>THE LOSS OF ALL.</h4>

<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">"Here</span> I am, Theo. Honor says you want to see me."</p>

<p>Evelyn Desmond closed the door behind her; and at sight of
her husband transformed into his very self&mdash;freed at last
from all disfigurements&mdash;she ran to him with outstretched
arms.</p>

<p>"Theo, are you really all right again? I can hardly believe
it."</p>

<p>But Desmond had no answer to give her. He simply squared his
right arm, warding off her hands.</p>

<p>Then she saw the hard lines of his mouth, the inexpressible
pain in his eyes; and, clutching at his rigid forearm, tried
to force it down. She might as well have tried to shift a
bar of iron.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you now?" she asked, half petulant,
half fearful. "Has anything else gone wrong? Haven't we had
enough misery and depression&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"There's no more call for acting, Evelyn," Desmond
interposed with an ominous quietness more disconcerting than
anger&mdash;"Doesn't your own conscience tell you what may have
gone wrong?"</p>

<p>At that the colour left her face. "You mean&mdash;is it
about&mdash;me?" she asked with shaking lips.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes. About you." Her pitiful aspect softened him; he took
her arm and set her gently down upon a chair;&mdash;the selfsame
chair that Paul had occupied half an hour ago. "Don't be
frightened," he said gently; "I won't hurt you more than I
must. Ever since we married I have done my utmost to help
you, spare you, shield you; but now&mdash;we've got to arrive at
a clear understanding, once for all. First I want you to
answer a question or two, straightly, without prevarication.
You went out early, it seems. Where?"</p>

<p>"To Mrs Riley's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And after?"</p>

<p>"I met Mr Kresney&mdash;quite by chance. He wanted me to come in
to tea. He said Miss Kresney would soon be home&mdash;and
I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No need for polite fabrications;" he took her up quickly.
"You went in. Miss Kresney did <i>not</i> come home. Is this the
first time he has trapped you with a convenient lie? Tell me
that."</p>

<p>Words and tone roused her to a passing flash of retaliation.</p>

<p>"If you're going to get so angry, Theo, I won't tell you
<i>any</i>thing, and I <i>won't</i> be questioned like a creature in a
witness-box! Some one's been saying horrid things of me.
Major Wyndham, I suppose. You wouldn't listen to any one
else. It's very mean of him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Desmond took a hasty step forward. "How dare you speak so of
the straightest man living!" he cried with imperious heat.
"You, who have taken advantage of my blindness to deceive me
deliberately a second time, on account of a cad who isn't
fit to tie your shoe-strings. I've been blind in more than
one way lately. But that is over now. I am not likely to
repeat the mistake of trusting you implicitly&mdash;after this."</p>

<p>She cowered under the lash of his just wrath, hiding her
face and crying heart-broken tears&mdash;the bitterest she had
yet shed. In snatching at the shadow it seemed she had lost
the substance past recall.</p>

<p>"Oh! You are cruel&mdash;horrible!" she wailed, with her
disarming, pathetic air of a scolded child that made a rough
word to her seem cowardly as a blow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>
<p>"No need to break your heart over it," he said more gently;
"and as to cruelty, Evelyn, haven't you abused my faith in
your loyalty and dragged my pride in the dust by letting
your name be coupled with that man's, though I told you
plainly I had good reasons for distrusting and disliking
him. I suppose he made a dead set at you while I was
away&mdash;cowardly brute! But what hits me hardest of all is not
your indiscretion; it's your persistent crookedness that
poisons everything. It was the same over your bills last
year&mdash;as I told you then. It's the same now. It's a poor
look-out if a man can't trust his own wife; but I suppose
you must have lied to me&mdash;and to Honor, a dozen times this
last week."</p>

<p>It had cost him an effort to speak so plainly and at such
length; but his wife's uneven breathing was the only answer
he received.</p>

<p>He came closer and laid an arm round her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Evelyn&mdash;Ladybird&mdash;have you nothing to say to me?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no," she answered in a choked voice, without uncovering
her face; "it wouldn't be any use."</p>

<p>"Why not? Am I so utterly devoid of understanding?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no. But you brave, strong sort of people can't ever
know how hard little things are for&mdash;for people like me. It
has been so&mdash;dull lately. You had&mdash;all those men, and&mdash;I was
lonely. It was nice to have some one&mdash;wanting me&mdash;some one
not miles above my head. But I knew you would be cross if I
told you&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;" tears choked her utterance&mdash;"oh, it's
no good talking. You'd never understand."</p>

<p>"I understand this much, my dear," he said. "You are done up
with the strain of nursing, and badly in need of a change.
But we shall soon get away on leave now; and I will see to
it that you shall never feel dull or out of it again. Only
one thing I insist upon&mdash;your intimacy with&mdash;that man is at
an end. No more riding with him; no more going to his
bungalow. From to-day you treat him and his sister as mere
acquaintances."</p>

<p>She faced him now with terror-stricken eyes. For while he
spoke, she had perceived the full extent of her dilemma.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>
<p>"But, Theo&mdash;there isn't any need for that," she urged, with
a thrill of fear at her own boldness. "They would think it
so odd. What excuses could I possibly make?"</p>

<p>"That's your affair," Desmond answered unmoved. "You are a
better hand at it than I am. My only concern is that you
shall put an end to this equivocal state of things for
good."</p>

<p>At that she hid her face again, with a sob of despair. "I
can't do it&mdash;I <i>can't</i>. It's impossible!" she murmured
vehemently more to herself than to him.</p>

<p>Her unexpected opposition fanned his smouldering wrath to a
blaze. He took her by the shoulder&mdash;not roughly, but very
decisively.</p>

<p>"<i>Impossible!</i> What am I to understand by that?"</p>

<p>It was the first time he had touched her untenderly; and she
quivered in every nerve.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know. I can't explain. But&mdash;it's true."</p>

<p>For one instant he stood speechless;&mdash;then:</p>

<p>"Great Heavens, Evelyn!" he broke out, "don't you see that
you are forcing upon me a suspicion that is an insult to us
both?"</p>

<p>She looked up at him in blank bewilderment, then jerked
herself free from his hand.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't understand what you mean. But if you <i>will</i>
think horrid things of me you may. I can't explain and&mdash;I
won't!"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;<i>won't</i>," Desmond repeated slowly, frozen incredulity
in his eyes; and she, fearing she had gone too far, caught
at the hand she had shaken off.</p>

<p>"Oh, Theo, what <i>does</i> it matter after all?" she urged
between irritation and despair, "when you know quite well
it's you&mdash;that I love?"</p>

<p>The appeal was too ill-timed to be convincing; and Desmond's
smile had a tinge of bitterness in it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>
<p>"You have an uncommonly original way of showing it," he
said coldly; "and the statement doesn't square with your
refusal to explain yourself. You have broken up the
foundations of&mdash;things to-day, Evelyn! You have killed my
trust in you altogether. You may remember, perhaps,&mdash;what
that involves." And withdrawing his hand he turned and left
her.</p>

<p>But he had roused her at last by the infliction of a pain
too intense for tears. She sprang up, knocking over the
chair that fell with a thud on the carpet, and hurried after
him, clinging to his unresponsive arm.</p>

<p>"Theo, Theo, take care what you say! Do you mean&mdash;truthfully
that you don't&mdash;love me any more?"</p>

<p>"God knows," he answered wearily. "Let me alone now, for
Heaven's sake, till I can see things clearer. But I'll not
alter my decision about Kresney, whatever your mysterious
impossibilities may be."</p>

<p>Freeing himself gently but deliberately, he went over to the
verandah door and stood there, erect, motionless, his back
towards her, looking out upon the featureless huts of the
servants' quarters with eyes that saw nothing save a vision
of his wife's face, as it had shone upon him, more than two
years ago, in the Garden of Tombs.</p>

<p>And it was shining upon him now&mdash;had he but guessed it,&mdash;not
with the simple tenderness of girlhood; but with the
despairing half-worshipping love of a woman.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>
<p>When he heard the door close softly behind her, he came
back into the room, mechanically righted the chair, and
sitting down upon it buried his face in his hands.</p>

<h4>EVEN TO THE UTMOST.</h4>

<div class="blockpoem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"How can Love lose, doing of its kind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">Even to the utmost?"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Edwin Arnold.</span></span><br />
<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Evelyn Desmond stumbled out of her husband's presence,
stunned, bewildered, blinded with tears, the one coherent
thought left in her mind was&mdash;Honor. Amid all that was
terrifying and heart-breaking, Honor's love stood sure; a
rock in mid-ocean&mdash;the one certainty that would never fail
her, though the world went to pieces under her feet.</p>

<p>But Honor was not in the drawing-room; and Evelyn knocked
timidly at her door.</p>

<p>"Come in," the low voice sounded from the other side. The
girl was standing before the looking-glass, pinning on her
hat.</p>

<p>"I was going across to ask after Mr Bradley," she explained,
completing the operation before looking round. But at sight
of Evelyn's face she hurried forward, holding out her arms.</p>

<p>"Dearest, what <i>has</i> happened to make you look like that?"</p>

<p>"Everything's happened! It's all finished between Theo and
me. Broken up. He said so&mdash;and&mdash;I'm going away. There
are&mdash;other people who care. I won't stay with a man who
doesn't love me&mdash;or trust me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Honor, holding her closer, looked searchingly into her
face. "Evelyn, that is <i>not true!</i>"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, he said so. And <i>he</i> doesn't tell lies!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you poor, poor child!" Honor murmured, kissing her with
a strange fervour of sympathy. "But tell me&mdash;what's the
reason of all this? If Theo did say such terrible things, he
must have been cruelly hurt or very angry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was&mdash;very angry. I'm sure he won't forgive me this time;
and I do believe it would be better all round if I went
right away and left him in peace with his polo and his
squadron and his precious Frontier Force&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Honor's hand closed her lips. "My dear! Are you <i>quite</i>
mad?"</p>

<p>"No. But I think I will be&mdash;very soon."</p>

<p>She spoke with such tragic certainty that the girl smiled in
spite of herself. "Why? What have you done? Tell me&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>"Oh! It's not <i>me</i> that's done," Evelyn declared with her
engaging air of injured innocence. "It's other people&mdash;Major
Wyndham, I believe&mdash;making remarks to him about me and&mdash;Mr
Kresney."</p>

<p>"You've been <i>there</i> again. I was half afraid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why on earth shouldn't I? But now Theo's simply ordered me
to drop them. It's quite impossible. I&mdash;I told him so."</p>

<p>"And you did not tell him why?"</p>

<p>"No. That would have been worse than all."</p>

<p>"But you will tell <i>me</i>. You must&mdash;if I am to help you."</p>

<p>Evelyn regarded her with a misty smile. "You're very
wonderful, Honor. But even <i>you</i> can't help now. You
see&mdash;it's money&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Money? How? What?"</p>

<p>"Promise you won't stop loving me and be angry&mdash;like Theo
was," Evelyn pleaded, the incurable child flashing out in
the midst of her distress. "I've had enough for to-day."</p>

<p>"I promise, dear. Go on."</p>

<p>Then the small sordid tragedy came out in broken snatches,
to the last particle. For once in her life Evelyn Desmond
spoke the unvarnished truth, adorning nothing, extenuating
nothing; and Honour listened in an enigmatical silence&mdash;a
silence which held even after the last word had been spoken.
Evelyn looked up at her nervously.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>
<p>"Honour, you <i>are</i> angry inside. I can see you are."</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;I am not angry," Honor answered slowly. "Where would
be the use? I am simply&mdash;astounded that you could <i>dare</i> to
run such risks with the love of a man who is one among a
thousand."</p>

<p>She spoke the last words with unguarded enthusiasm; not
perceiving, till they were out, the intent look on Evelyn's
face.</p>

<p>"I knew you were friends with Theo, Honor," she said, "but I
never thought you admired him as much&mdash;as all <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>The girl caught the note of jealousy, and coloured to the
roots of her hair.</p>

<p>"I am not alone in my opinion," she said with an uneasy
laugh. "There are dozens of others who would say no less. It
is only that I want you to realise your good fortune before
it is too late."</p>

<p>"But it <i>is</i> too late. If he's angry now he'll be furious
when he knows. And unless I go away he will <i>have</i> to know."</p>

<p>"You shall not go away. And he must never know. He has
suffered enough as it is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Haven't <i>I</i> suffered just as much? You always think of
him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am thinking of you both. How much is it that you still
owe these Kresneys?"</p>

<p>"A hundred and fifty&mdash;no, two hundred. And I can't possibly
pay it for months and months."</p>

<p>By this time Honor had crossed to the chest of drawers near
her bed and had taken out a small japanned cash-box. Evelyn
watched her movements with ecstatic enlightenment.</p>

<p>"Honor&mdash;what <i>are</i> you going to do?" she asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>But the girl neither answered nor turned her head. She took
out a small sheaf of notes, locked the cash-box, and put it
away. Then taking an envelope from her rack, she sealed and
addressed it, while Evelyn leaned against the
dressing-table, white and speechless from the shock of
relief.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>
<p>"The whole amount is in there," Honor said, handing her the
envelope, and speaking in a repressed voice. "Luckily I had
hardly touched my month's money. This makes you free to do
as Theo wishes. I don't want a penny of it back&mdash;ever. And
Theo is never to know anything about the whole transaction.
Promise me that; and don't <i>dare</i> to break your word."</p>

<p>"I promise faithfully. Oh, Honor, you are my good angel!
Shall I take it now&mdash;at once?"</p>

<p>"No. Not you. I must go myself. It ought to be delivered to
him in person, and I must have a stamped receipt."</p>

<p>"Honor, how horrid! Just as if he were a shop!
Besides&mdash;nobody but <i>me</i> can give it&mdash;or explain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How can you explain? What will you say?"</p>

<p>"Just whatever comes into my head. Married women understand
these sort of things. I shall know what to say&mdash;at the
time."</p>

<p>"So will he. And then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There you go!" Tears threatened again and her voice shook.
"You talk about loving me and you don't trust me any more
than Theo does. If I mayn't do this my own way I won't take
the money at all."</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense, child," Honor cried desperately, her
own self-control almost at an end. "You <i>must</i> take it. And
if you insist on running risks with your eyes open, there's
no more to be said except make haste and get the wretched
thing done with. Go at once, in your jhampan&mdash;and <i>don't</i>
leave it. Ask for Miss Kresney; and&mdash;shop or no shop&mdash;mind
you get a proper receipt. Then come straight home and tell
Theo you will do what he wishes. He will have had time to
think things over and it will be all right. I know it will.
Perhaps you would like me to speak of it to him, if I get
the chance?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes. Do, please! You dear, wonderful Honor! I don't
know how to say thank you enough&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Honor disengaged herself something hurriedly. The ache
of rebellion at her heart made Evelyn's effusiveness
unendurable.</p>

<p>"Don't thank me at all," she said. "I don't want your
thanks. I don't&mdash;deserve them. Take care of that envelope;
it is worth more than two hundred rupees to you&mdash;and to me.
Now go!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>
<p>And taking her by the shoulders, she put her gently outside
the door. Then, drawing a deep breath of relief, stood alone
with the realisation of all that had passed.</p>

<p>It seemed that she was not to be spared one drop of the cup
of bitterness; that to her had been assigned the task of
Sisyphus, the ceaseless rolling upward of a stone that as
ceaselessly rolled down; the continual re-establishment of
Evelyn in the shrine of her husband's heart. And there would
be no end to it, even after John's return. So long as these
two had need of her, heart and brain and hands would be at
their service. She did not definitely think this, because
true heroism is unaware of itself. "It feels, and never
reasons; and therefore is always right."</p>

<p>Honor was aware of nothing just then, but the keen pang of
self-reproach. "God forgive me!" she murmured, forming the
words with her lips. "I did it for <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>Then she started, and the blood flew to her face. For
Desmond's voice, imperious, entreating, rang clear through
the quiet of the house.</p>

<p>"Ladybird, where <i>are</i> you? Come back!"</p>

<p>And without a thought of what she intended to say, Honor
went out to the completion of her day's work. That was her
practical way of looking at the matter.</p>

<p>"It will be easy enough," she reflected as she went. The
entreaty in Desmond's voice assured her of that.</p>

<p>But in the drawing-room doorway she stood still,
extraordinarily still. For Desmond himself confronted her;
and she had not anticipated the ordeal of a face-to-face
encounter.</p>

<p>Involuntarily, inevitably, their eyes met, and lingered in
each other's depths. It was their first real greeting since
his return; and they felt it as such. It was the first time
also that Desmond had seen her completely since his
lightning-flash of self-knowledge; and in the same instant
the same thought sprang to both their minds&mdash;that, in the
past three weeks, the detested shade had served them better
than they knew.</p>

<p>For a full minute it seemed as if these two, whose courage
was above proof, did not dare risk movement or speech. But
it was no more than a minute. Each was incapable of
suspecting the other's hidden fear; and now, as always,
Evelyn was the foremost thought in the minds of both.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>
<p>Desmond broke the spell by one step forward.</p>

<p>"I want Ladybird," he said abruptly. "Where is she?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. She has just gone out; but she won't be long."</p>

<p>Honor knew what must come next; knew also that she could
neither lie to him nor tell him the truth.</p>

<p>"What possessed her to go out again? Do you know where she
went?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Theo, I do know," she answered, coming into the room,
and speaking with a noble directness that was like a light
thrown across tortuous ways. "It was unavoidable. I would
rather not say any more. You can trust me, can't you?"</p>

<p>"As I trust God and my own soul," he replied with profound
conviction. "Did she seem&mdash;much upset?"</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;terribly upset. Not without reason. She told me
everything. May I speak of it, Theo? You won't think
me&mdash;intrusive?"</p>

<p>He gave her a quick, reproachful glance.</p>

<p>"<i>You?</i> Say what you please. I was a brute to her; and I
know it. But I swear I wasn't hard on her till she refused
to break with Kresney. Did she give you any sort of reason
for that?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I have quite cleared up the difficulty; though I'm
afraid you mustn't ask me how."</p>

<p>"You seem hedged about with mysteries this evening," he
remarked, a trifle curtly. "I confess I like daylight, and
straight roads."</p>

<p>"Not more than I do, Theo. But you have said you can trust
me; and at least I can assure you that there was no question
of personal reluctance. Whatever Evelyn's failings may be, I
know that <i>you</i> are the one big thing in her life."</p>

<p>Desmond compressed his lips, and looked down thoughtfully at
the bearskin under his feet; while Honor allowed her eyes to
dwell on the goodly lines of his face. Then he squared his
shoulders and looked up at her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>
<p>"Honor&mdash;if that is true&mdash;and I think it is&mdash;you are bound
to let me help her by the only means in my power. Give me
back that promise of mine. I am strong enough now to tackle
the subject; and I warn you fairly that I mean to have my
own way. So don't waste time by beating about the bush."</p>

<p>The unexpected attack unbalanced her, and the blood left her
face; but there was no hint of yielding in her eyes. They
were equally matched these two&mdash;strength for strength; will
for will. The ultimate victory might rest with either.</p>

<p>"Theo!" she protested, "you can ask that of me&mdash;to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, precisely&mdash;to-day. My mistake&mdash;my selfishness, has
been very painfully brought home to me in the last hour; and
I don't ask it of you&mdash;I demand it."</p>

<p>Honor drew herself up to her full height.</p>

<p>"You cannot command it, though," she said quietly. "And&mdash;I
refuse."</p>

<p>The hot blood mounted to his temples, but he shut his teeth
to keep back hasty speech. Then, as the silence grew and
deepened between them, anger gave place to an unbounded
admiration.</p>

<p>They were standing now face to face, beside the mantelpiece,
exactly as they had stood on that eventful April afternoon a
year ago. The memory came to them simultaneously; and each
saw the light of it spring into the other's eyes. Honor's
face softened.</p>

<p>"You remember," she urged. "I see that you remember; and the
arguments you admitted then hold even more strongly now.
Besides&mdash;you said I had earned the right&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>
<p>"So you have&mdash;ten times over since then. But to-day I see
my duty to Ladybird so clearly, that no one&mdash;not even
you&mdash;must stand in the way of it. You would realise better
how I feel, if you had heard her pitiful excuses. She was
'dull.' She was 'lonely.' I had 'all those men,'&mdash;so I had.
She was right, poor child! Truth is, my life is so richly
filled with 'all those men,' that I sometimes wonder if I
was justified in bringing a woman into it at all. But having
done so, I'm bound to take her where she won't be tempted to
entangle herself with cads like Kresney, just because she
feels dull and lonely. That's the source of half the
catastrophes one hears of in this country; and in nine cases
out of ten I blame the husband more than the wife. You see,
I happen to believe that when a man takes a woman's life
into his hands, he makes himself responsible not only for
her honour, but for her happiness and well-being. I'm not
setting up a standard for other fellows, remember. I am
simply stating my own by way of explanation."</p>

<p>Honor's eyes shone with a very tender light.</p>

<p>"I can only say that Evelyn is&mdash;a singularly fortunate
woman. If most men held such views there would be ninety per
cent fewer marriages in the world."</p>

<p>"Possibly. But that doesn't put me in the wrong. Now, I have
set the picture before you as I see it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, with the core of it left out,&mdash;the loss to you and to
the Regiment."</p>

<p>"Oh, hang it all!" Desmond protested with an embarrassed
laugh. "One's bound to leave out something. That's the whole
art of making a decent picture! But it strikes me we've had
enough of argument. Whether I have convinced you or not,
Honor, you <i>must</i> let me off that promise."</p>

<p>The girl held her breath, nerving herself for a last
desperate stand.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, if you know how, Theo," she said; "but I
cannot&mdash;I will not give up my right to save you from
yourself."</p>

<p>Desmond simply raised his head and looked at her, as though
he could not believe that he had heard aright; and when at
last he spoke, his voice had the level note of authority
which she had been dreading to hear.</p>

<p>"At the risk of seeming brutal, Honor, I warn you that I'll
not give you one minute's peace till you unsay those
words&mdash;for Ladybird's sake."</p>

<p>Then, to his unspeakable consternation, she took a step
backward and sank into the chair behind her, pressing both
hands over her eyes.</p>

<p>"Do whatever you think right," she murmured brokenly. "You
are too strong for me altogether."</p>

<p>There are victories more bitter than defeat; and Desmond had
no words in which to answer this girl, who cared so
strangely, so intensely, much what became of him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>
<p>When a woman breaks down utterly in the presence of the man
who loves her&mdash;whether he dare acknowledge it or no&mdash;words
are not apt to meet the exigencies of the case; and Desmond
had no other panacea at his command. He could only stand
looking down upon her, his hands thrust deep into his
pockets, as if he feared that they might go out to her of
their own accord; his eyes darkened with such intensity of
pain that it was well for both that hers were shielded from
sight of them.</p>

<p>He longed, beyond all things on earth, to kneel down and
comfort her. He knew that three words from him would put an
end to her distress, and cancel his own quixotic plan of
action. But the words were not uttered; and he remained
standing on the hearth-rug with his hands in his pockets.
There was no sign in the quiet room that anything noteworthy
had taken place. Yet on those two prosaic details the future
of three lives depended&mdash;a man silent when he might have
spoken; planted squarely on his feet when he might have been
on his knees.</p>

<p>Rob got up and stretched himself elaborately, vented his
boredom in a long musical yawn, then settled down to sleep
again in a more expansive attitude; and Evelyn's French
clock struck six with cheerful unconcern.</p>

<p>The silence, which seemed interminable, might possibly have
lasted three minutes, when Honor let fall her hands, and
looked up at the man who had mastered her. He looked what he
was&mdash;unconquerable; and if she had not loved him already,
she must infallibly have loved him then.</p>

<p>"Please understand," she said, and her voice was not quite
steady, "that I have not <i>given</i> my consent to this. You
have simply wrenched it from me by the sheer force of&mdash;your
personality. You have not altered my conviction by a
hair's-breadth. What you have set your heart on is a piece
of unjustifiable quixotism; and I have only one thing to beg
of you now. Do nothing decisive till you have spoken to
Paul."</p>

<p>Desmond sighed.</p>

<p>"Very well. I will tackle him to-morrow."</p>

<p>"What a hurry you are in!" And she smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"I believe in striking while the iron's hot."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>
<p>"And I believe in giving it time to cool. May I&mdash;first, say
one word to Paul?"</p>

<p>"No, certainly not." The refusal came out short and sharp.
"If you two combined forces against me I should be done for!
Leave me to manage Paul alone."</p>

<p>With a sigh she rose to her feet.</p>

<p>Then, quite suddenly, her calmness fell away from her.</p>

<p>"Theo&mdash;Theo," she protested, "if you really persist in this,
and carry it through, I don't think I shall ever forgive
you."</p>

<p>The pain in her voice was more than he could bear.</p>

<p>"For God's sake spare me that!" he pleaded. "I am losing
enough as it is."</p>

<p>And now his hands went out to her irresistibly, in the old
impulsive fashion, that seemed an echo from a former life.</p>

<p>With superlative courage she turned and surrendered both her
own. She wanted to prove herself, at all points, simply his
friend; and he gave her no cause to repent of her courage,
or to suspect the strong restraint he put upon himself
during that brief contact, which, at a moment so charged
with emotion, might well have proved fatal to them both.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Honor," he said quietly.</p>

<p>But for her, speech was impossible. She bowed her head, and
left him standing alone, with the dregs of victory.</p>

<p>On reaching the blessed shelter of her own room she bolted
the door; and for once in her life grief had its way with
her unhindered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>
<p>She could not guess, while railing against Desmond's
tenacity of purpose, that the same passionate self-reproach
which had urged her to go all lengths for Evelyn, was urging
him now to a supreme act of self-devotion to his wife's
happiness.</p>

<h4>THE ONE BIG THING.</h4>

<div class="blockpoem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"The sky that noticed all makes no disclosure;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">And earth keeps up her terrible composure."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 21em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Browning.</span></span><br />
<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">His</span> wife herself was, in the meanwhile, journeying hopefully
back to the Kresneys' bungalow, on the shoulders of four
long-suffering jhampanis, who murmured a little among
themselves, without rancour or vexation, concerning the
perplexing ways of Memsahibs in general. For the native of
India the supreme riddle of creation is the English "Mem."</p>

<p>They had but just cast aside their liveries and, squatting
on their heels in a patch of shadow, had embarked on
leisurely preparations for the evening hookah and the
evening meal. The scent of curry was in their nostrils; the
regular "flip-flap" of the deftly turned chupattie was in
their ears; when a flying order had come from the
house&mdash;"The Memsahib goes forth in haste!" With resigned
mutterings and head-shakings they had responded to the call
of duty, and the <i>mate</i>,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> who was a philosopher, had a
word of comfort for them as they went. "Worse might have
befallen, brothers, seeing that it hath pleased God to make
our Memsahib light as a bird. Had it been the Miss Sahib,
now&mdash;&mdash;" A unanimous murmur testified that the Miss Sahib
would have been a far weightier affair!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>
<p>And on this occasion they must have found their mistress
even lighter than a bird; for instead of lying back among
her cushions, she sat upright, in strained anticipation,
pressing between her hands the miraculous envelope which was
to buy back for her all that she had so lightly flung away.</p>

<p>Honor had spoken truth when she said that Desmond was the
one big thing in Evelyn's life. Everything else about her
was small as her person, and little more effectual. But this
impetuous, large-hearted husband of hers&mdash;whose love she had
been so proud to win, and had taken such small pains to
keep&mdash;could by no means be chiselled into proportions with
the rest of the picture. He took his stand, simply and
naturally, on the heights; and if it was an effort to keep
up with him, it was a real calamity to be left behind.
Understand him she could not, and never would; but it
sufficed that she saw him fearless, chivalrous, admired on
all sides, and singularly good to look at. This last should
perhaps have been set down first; for there is no denying
that her remorse, her suffering, had been less overwhelming
without that unexpected vision of his face.</p>

<p>But things were going to be all right soon. She would never
hide anything from him again&mdash;never. And the resolve may be
counted unto her for righteousness, even if there could be
small hope of its fulfilment.</p>

<p>Such absorbing considerations crowded out all thought of
Honor's generosity. It was just Honor. No one else would
ever give you two hundred rupees, at a moment's notice, as
if it were sixpence. But you might expect anything from
Honor&mdash;that was how she was made. And the one important
point was&mdash;Theo. Nothing else really mattered at all.</p>

<p>As Kresney's bungalow came in sight she found herself
fervently hoping that he might have gone out; that she might
have to encounter nothing more formidable than Miss Kresney,
or, better still, the bearer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>
<p>But before the gate was reached, she caught sight of him in
the verandah, taking his ease very completely in one of
those ungainly chairs, with arms extending to long wooden
leg-rests, which seem to belong to India and no other
country in the world. He had exchanged his coat for a
Japanese smoking jacket, whose collar and cuffs could ill
afford to brave daylight; and his boots for slippers of
Linda's making, whose conflicting colours might have set an
oyster's teeth on edge! His own teeth were clenched upon a
rank cigar; and he was reading a paper-bound novel that she
would not have touched with a pair of tongs.</p>

<p>He had never appeared to worse advantage; and Evelyn, fresh
from her husband's air of unobtrusive neatness and
distinction, was conscious of a sudden recoil&mdash;a purely
physical revulsion; to which was added the galling thought
that she owed her recent suffering and humiliation to her
intimacy with a man who could look like that!</p>

<p>As she turned in at the gate, he sprang up and ran down the
steps. Her return astounded him. He was prepared for
anything at that moment, except the thing that happened&mdash;a
common human experience.</p>

<p>"Back again, Mrs Desmond!" he cried cheerfully. "This is a
most unexpected pleasure. <i>Rukho jhampan.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>But Evelyn countermanded the order so promptly that
Kresney's eyebrows went up. She handed him her note,
clutching the wooden pole nervously with the other hand.</p>

<p>"I had to come out again&mdash;on business," she said, with that
ready mingling of the false and true which had been her
undoing. "And I thought I could leave this for Miss Kresney
as I passed. Will you please give it to her. I am sorry she
is not in."</p>

<p>He took the envelope, and watched her while she spoke with
narrowed eyes.</p>

<p>"You are in trouble?" The intimate note in his voice jarred
for the first time. "Something has upset you since you left?
You are quite knocked up with all this. You ought to have
been in Murree two weeks ago."</p>

<p>And, presumably by accident, his hand came down upon her
own. She drew it away with an involuntary shudder; and
Kresney's sallow face darkened.</p>

<p>"You have no business to say that," she rebuked him with
desperate courage; "I prefer to be with my husband till he
is well enough to go too. You won't forget my note, will
you? Good-night."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>
<p>"Good-night, Mrs Desmond," he answered formally, without
proffering his hand.</p>

<p>As he stood watching her depart, all that was worst in him
rose to the surface and centred in his close-set eyes. "By
God, you shall be sorry for that!" he muttered.</p>

<p>But in mounting the steps his curiosity was awakened by the
bulkiness of Linda's letter. He turned it over once or
twice; pressed it between his fingers and detected the
crackle of new bank-notes.</p>

<p>"So that's it, is it? Well, I can forgive her. No doubt she
had a jolly hot quarter of an hour; and I hope that fellow
is enjoying himself now&mdash;<i>like hell!</i>" Then, without a
glimmer of hesitation, he opened his sister's letter.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>And, out in the road, Evelyn's jhampanis were experiencing
fresh proof of the indubitable madness of Memsahibs.</p>

<p>No sooner were their faces set cheerfully homeward, than
they were brought up short by an order to turn and carry her
in the opposite direction. No destination was specified; and
the road indicated led out towards the hills. Hookahs and
chupatties tugging at their heart-strings, roused them to
mild rebellion. The mate, as established spokesman, murmured
of <i>khana</i><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
 and the lateness of the hour; adding that the
road behind them led away from the Sahibs' bungalows to the
boundary of the station.</p>

<p>But Evelyn, whose Hindustani was still a negligible
quantity, made no attempt to follow the man's remarks. She
reiterated her wish, adding irritably, "Make no foolish
talk. It is an order!"</p>

<p>Those magic words, <i>Hukm hai</i>, are the insignia of authority
through the length and breadth of India; and consoling one
another with the reflection that if the Memsahib had small
understanding, the Sahib was great, they jogged obediently
along the lonely road toward the hills.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>
<p>Evelyn's order had been given on the impulse of a moment.
The idea of confronting her husband again in less than ten
minutes had overpowered her suddenly and completely. She had
only one thought&mdash;to gain-time; to screw up her courage for
the ordeal; and to realise a little what she intended to
say. It is only the strong who dare to trust that the right
words will be given them.</p>

<p>Her interview with Kresney had unnerved her; and a lurking
doubt quenched the spark of hope at her heart. Would Theo
accept her tardy obedience without asking unanswerable
questions. Or would he simply put her aside, with his
inexorable quietness, that was far more terrible than any
spoken word?</p>

<p>In all the pain and bewilderment of their short interview,
nothing had so smitten her as his recoil&mdash;first and
last&mdash;from the touch of her hands. The bare possibility that
he might treat her so again made return seem out of the
question. And her unhappiness struck deeper than the fear of
the moment. For the first time she realised her own
instability of feeling and purpose; and with the realisation
came a new paralysing fear of the future&mdash;of herself.</p>

<p>For the first time it dawned upon her that she was unworthy
of the love and faith that had been given her in such
generous measure;&mdash;which was proof conclusive, though she
did not guess it, that Honor Meredith had not laboured in
vain. To know oneself unworthy is to have achieved the first
step upward. A year ago she would have been incapable of
such knowledge; and now that it had come to her she was
afraid.</p>

<p>Sudden cessation of movement roused her; and the mate,
turning his head, spoke with respectful urgency.</p>

<p>"Protector of the Poor, it is not well to go farther. Behold
the swift going of the sun. Before your servants can reach
the bungalow there will be no more light, and it is against
orders&mdash;&mdash;The Sahib will make angry talk."</p>

<p>Evelyn did not follow the whole of this appeal; but the
man's anxiety was evident. She caught the words "Sahib" and
"angry" with an inward shudder; she had endured enough of
the Sahib's anger for one day, and her own common-sense told
her that she had behaved foolishly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>
<p>Even outlying bungalows were no longer in sight. A boundary
pillar gleamed ghostlike a few hundred yards ahead. The last
rim of the sun had already slipped behind the hills. Their
harsh peaks black against a sky of faint amber, had a
threatening look; and darkness was racing up out of the
east. The mate was right. It would be upon them almost
before they could reach the bungalow; and to be out after
sunset was strictly against the rules of the station.</p>

<p>Sudden terror clutched her; a nameless dread of the
country&mdash;of the natives&mdash;which she had never been able to
shake off; a paralysing sense that she was alone in their
midst&mdash;alone on the verge of night.</p>

<p>Fear unsteadied her voice as she answered the man. "Turn,
turn at once, and go quickly,&mdash;run; the Sahib will give
<i>jacksheesh</i>&mdash;run!"</p>

<p>But before they could obey, a white figure sprang up from
behind a cluster of rocks. Quick as thought followed a
flash, a report, a heart-piercing scream; and the men, with
a cry of "Ghazi! Ghazi!" unceremoniously set down their
mistress and fled.</p>

<p>The fanatic fled also, certain of a passport into Paradise;
and as Evelyn Desmond fell back among her cushions, a
shadow, that had not been there before, crept slowly across
the shoulder of her muslin dress. The oncoming darkness
mattered nothing to her now; and she herself, a mere atom of
life, blown out like a candle, mattered less than nothing to
the desert and the imperturbable hills.</p>

<p>But justice does not invariably tarry. The arm of the Lord
is not shortened, though in these days of omniscience man
has a larger faith in his own; and the Ghazi, heading
post-haste through the dusk plunged unwittingly into a group
of villagers and cattle returning home.</p>

<p>A short scuffle ensued, shouts and the tramping of
feet&mdash;sounds which brought the flying jhampanis back in a
twinkling, surcharged with voluble valour and explanations.
Resistance was useless. Moreover, to the fanatic, death is
the one great gift. With stoical indifference the man found
himself overpowered and disarmed. Zealous villagers,
unrolling turbans and kummerbunds, made fast his arms, bound
him securely about the waist and neck, and in this
ignominious fashion led him back to where Evelyn Desmond lay
untroubled and alone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>
<p>The jhampanis shouldered their burden once more; and fell
to discussing, in lively detail, the hanging and subsequent
burning that awaited the Taker of Life, who walked
unconcernedly in their midst.</p>

<h4>C'ÉTAIT MA VIE.</h4>

<div class="blockpoem">
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">"C'était toute petite, ma vie:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">Mais c'était ma vie."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Anatole France.</span></span><br />
<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">"Honor</span>, come out! I want you."</p>

<p>Desmond's voice, followed by a peremptory rap on the door,
startled the girl back to a realisation of the flight of
time. The sun had set, and a grey light filled the room.
Without a passing thought of the tears upon her face, she
lowered the bolt and confronted Evelyn's husband.</p>

<p>"Ladybird isn't back yet," he said quickly. "It'll be dark
in ten minutes. I <i>must</i> know where she went to, and go
after her myself."</p>

<p>Honor bit her lip. To tell him at such a moment would be
madness; yet he was in an ill mood to oppose.</p>

<p>"Can't you send the orderly?" she asked, with something less
than her wonted assurance.</p>

<p>"No. I am going myself. This is no time to fuss over
trifles. Something may have gone wrong&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush,&mdash;listen! What's that?"</p>

<p>The shuffling and grunting of jhampanis, and the thud of the
lowered dandy, were distinctly audible in the stillness.</p>

<p>"There she is!" Desmond said eagerly; and a moment later the
blood in his veins was chilled by a long-drawn wail from the
verandah. "Hai&mdash;hai&mdash;<i>mere Memsahib murgya!</i>"
<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>
<p>Before the cry had spent itself he was through the "chick,"
down the verandah steps at a bound, and bending over his
unconscious wife. Her head had dropped down to one shoulder,
and on the other ominous stains showed darkly in the half
light.</p>

<p>"Great God&mdash;<i>murder!</i>" Desmond muttered between his teeth.
"What devil's work is this?" he added, turning upon the
cowering jhampanis.</p>

<p>"Ghazi, Sahib; Ghazi," they told him in eager chorus, with a
childish mingling of excitement and terror; and would fain
have enlarged upon their own valour in pursuing the Taker of
Life, but that Desmond's curt "<i>chupraho</i>"<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> checked them
in mid-career.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are, Honor," he added to the girl, who had
followed him, and now stood at the head of the steps. "I am
bringing her in."</p>

<p>"Is she&mdash;alive?"</p>

<p>"God knows. Look sharp and get some brandy."</p>

<p>He took up one limp hand and laid his fingers on her wrist.
A faint flutter of life rewarded him.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!" he murmured; and lifted her tenderly in his
arms. But at the foot of the steps he paused.</p>

<p>"Nassur Ali&mdash;the Doctor Sahib. Ride like the wind!" Then
turning again to the jhampanis, big with harrowing detail,
added: "The devil who did this thing, hath he escaped?"</p>

<p>"<i>Nahin</i>, <i>nahin</i>,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Sahib. Would your Honour's servants
permit? The jackal spawn is even now in the hands of the
police. May his soul burn in hell&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is enough&mdash;go!" Desmond commanded in the peremptory
vernacular; and mounted the steps with his burden.</p>

<p>Honor stood awaiting him in the drawing-room, white as her
dress, tears glistening on her cheeks and lashes, yet very
composed withal.</p>

<p>At sight of his face she started; it was grey-white and set
like a rock. Only the eyes were alive&mdash;and ruthless, as she
had never yet seen them, and prayed that she never might see
them again.</p>

<p>"They've got the man," he said between his teeth. "I wish to
God I could shoot him with my own hand."</p>

<p>Then he went forward to the sofa, and laid his wife upon it.
His quick eye detected at once the nature of the wound.
"Lung," he muttered mechanically. "No hope."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>
<p>With the same unnatural calmness, he drew the long pins out
of her hat&mdash;the poor, pretty hat which had so delighted her
six hours ago; and as she moved, with a small sound of pain,
he applied the spirit to her lips.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she murmured. "Don't touch me."</p>

<p>The faint note of distaste struck on her husband's heart;
for he did not understand its meaning.</p>

<p>"Ladybird&mdash;look!" he entreated gently. "It is Theo." She
opened her eyes, and gazed blankly up at him, where he
leaned above her.</p>

<p>Then, as recognition dawned, he saw the shadow of fear
darken them, and instantly dropped on one knee enclosing her
with his arm.</p>

<p>"Ladybird, forgive me! You must never be frightened of
me&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>The intensity of his low tone roused her half-awakened
brain.</p>

<p>"But you were so angry, I was&mdash;afraid to come home."</p>

<p>"My God!" the man groaned under his breath. But before he
could grasp the full horror of it all, she shrank closer to
him, clutching at his arm, her eyes wide with terror.</p>

<p>"There's blood on me&mdash;look! It was&mdash;that man. Is it bad? Am
I going&mdash;to die?"</p>

<p>"Not if human power can save you, my dear little woman.
Mackay will soon be here."</p>

<p>But pain and fear clouded her senses, and she scarcely heard
his words.</p>

<p>"Theo&mdash;I can't see you properly. Are you there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. I am here."</p>

<p>The necessity for speech tortured him. But her one coherent
longing was for the sound of his voice.</p>

<p>"<i>Don't</i> let me die, please&mdash;not yet. I won't make you angry
any more, I promise. And&mdash;it frightens me so. Keep tight
hold of me; don't let me slip&mdash;away."</p>

<p>Desmond had a sensation as if a hand had gripped his throat,
choking him, so that he could neither speak nor breathe. But
with a supreme effort he mastered it; and leaning closer to
her, spoke slowly, steadily, that she might lose no word of
the small comfort he had power to give.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>
<p>"I am holding you, my darling; and I will hold you to the
very end. Only try&mdash;try to be brave, and remember
that&mdash;whatever happens, you are safe&mdash;in God's hands."</p>

<p>A pitiful sob broke from her.</p>

<p>"But I don't understand about God! I only want&mdash;you. I want
<i>your</i> hands&mdash;always. Where is the other one? Put
it&mdash;underneath me&mdash;and hold me&mdash;ever so close."</p>

<p>He obeyed her, in silence, to the letter. She winced a
little at the movement; then her head nestled into its
resting-place on the wounded shoulder, with a sigh that had
in it no shadow of pain; and bending down he kissed her,
long and fervently.</p>

<p>"Theo&mdash;darling," she breathed ecstatically, when her lips
were free for speech, "now I <i>know</i> it isn't true&mdash;what you
said about not&mdash;caring any more. And I am&mdash;ever so happy.
God can't let me&mdash;die&mdash;now."</p>

<p>And on the word, a rush of blood from the damaged lung
brought on the inevitable choking cough, that shattered the
last remnant of her strength. Her fingers closed
convulsively upon his; and at the utmost height of
happiness&mdash;as it were, on the crest of a wave&mdash;her spirit
slipped from its moorings;&mdash;and he was alone.</p>

<p>Still he knelt on, without movement, without thought, almost
it seemed without breathing, like a man turned to stone;
holding her, as he had promised, to the very end,
and&mdash;beyond.</p>

<p>Honor, standing afar off, dazed and heart-broken, one hand
clasping the back of a chair for support, heard at last the
rattle of approaching hoofs, and nerved herself for the
ordeal of speech. But when Mackay entered with Paul Wyndham,
Desmond made no sign. The little doctor's keen eye took in
the situation at a glance; and at the unlooked-for relief of
Paul's presence, Honor's strained composure deserted her.
She swayed a little, stretched out a hand blindly towards
him, and would have fallen, but that he quietly put his arm
round her, and with a strange mixture of feelings saw her
head drop on to his shoulder. But it was only for a moment.
Contact with the roughness of his coat roused her on the
verge of unconsciousness. She drew herself up, a faint
colour mantling in her cheeks, and tried to smile.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>
<p>"Come away," Paul whispered, leading her to the door. "We
can give him no help&mdash;or comfort&mdash;yet."</p>

<h2>I.</h2>

<p>Some two weeks after that day of tragedy&mdash;a tragedy that had
stirred and enraged the whole station&mdash;Theo Desmond and Paul
Wyndham left Kohat on furlough, long over-due to both. Such
a wander-year, spent together, had, from early days, been
one of their cherished dreams; but, as too often happens,
there proved little family likeness between the dream and
the reality. In the dream, Desmond was naturally to be the
leading spirit of their grand tour. In the reality, all
practical plans and considerations had devolved on Paul, and
Theo it was who assented, unquestioning, uncaring, so long
as he could put half the world between himself and Kohat.</p>

<p>His long illness, the fear of losing his sight, the double
shock of self-revelation and loss had affected him mentally
as blow on blow affects a man physically. Since the night of
his wife's death none had seen him strongly moved, either by
sorrow, pleasure, or anger. He had said and done all that
was required of him with a strained unnatural precision.
Even to the few who had drawn nearest to him in former times
of trouble, he seemed now like a house whose every door is
locked and every shutter drawn.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>
<p>Outwardly unmoved, he had endured the ordeal of Evelyn's
funeral, the storm of public surprise and indignation
aroused by her murder. Though British officers, not a few,
have been victims to fanaticism in India, no Englishwoman
had ever been shot at before, and the strong feeling aroused
by so dastardly a crime had been long in subsiding. The news
had been wired to Peshawur. The Commissioner had galloped
across thirty miles of desert next morning; and before
Evelyn's funeral, at sundown, her death had been openly
avenged by the hanging of her murderer and the burning of
his body.</p>

<p>On that day Honor had gone over to Mrs Conolly's bungalow,
there to remain till Meredith's arrival; and in the two
weeks that followed, Desmond had seen little of her&mdash;or of
any one save Paul. She had helped him in disposing of
Evelyn's personal belongings; and at his earnest request,
had accepted one or two of her trinkets, the remainder being
sent home to her mother. At his request also, Honor had
taken over charge of his piano while he was away; and if a
touch of constraint marked their parting, neither was aware
of it in the other.</p>

<p>By one sole distinction he had set her apart from the rest.
To her, and her only, he could and did speak of his wife;
for the simple reason that in her he recognised a love and a
sorrow that matched his own&mdash;a sorrow untainted by the
lurking after thought, "Better so"; and that tacit
recognition had been for Honor the single ray of light in
her dark hour. Once, before parting, she had spoken of it to
Paul, who thenceforward knew his friend's aloofness for what
it was&mdash;not the mere reserve of the strong man in pain, but
the old incurable loyalty to his wife that had kept them all
at arm's length in respect of her while she lived.</p>

<p>So they two went forth together on their sorrowful
pilgrimage; and, once gone, there fell a curtain of silence
between Desmond and those he had left behind. Week after
week, month after month, that silence remained unbroken,
though Olliver and his wife wrote and John Meredith wrote
also on his return; though they plied him with questions,
with news of the Regiment and Border politics, never a sight
of his handwriting came to cheer them. But for Paul's
unfailing, if discouraging bulletins, no word of him would
have reached them at all.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>
<p>Honor herself wrote twice, without avail; and thereafter
accepted the fiat of silence, gleaning what comfort she
might from a steady correspondence with Paul. It was not in
her to guess how those fortnightly letters, so frank in
expression, so reserved in essence, had upheld him through
the darkest and most difficult months of his life; months in
which he could only stand aside and wait till the man he
loved, as Jonathan loved David, should come forth out of the
house of sorrow and take up the broken threads of life once
more.</p>

<p>Meantime, with inexhaustible patience, he continued to try
one place after another, one distraction after another, with
small result. It was a costly prescription, and though
Desmond imagined he contributed his share, the chief of it
was paid by his friend. During those first months he read
little, talked little, and rarely expressed a definite wish.
He would go anywhere, do anything in reason, so long as no
mental effort was required of him; but music&mdash;to Paul's
utter mystification&mdash;he decisively refused to hear. For the
time being the man's whole nature seemed awry, and there
were moments when Paul's heart contracted with dread of the
worst.</p>

<p>Christmas found them at Le Trayas, on the Esterelles coast,
an isolated paradise unprofaned by sight or sound of the
noisy, restless life of the French Riviera. Here Theo
Desmond had spent whole hours at a stretch, basking in the
temperate December sunshine, under feathery mimosa bushes,
that glorify the foothills,&mdash;silent as ever, yet seemingly
content.</p>

<p>Still he wrote no line to the Regiment, that for thirteen
years had stood second only to his God, and very rarely
asked for news of it or his friends. By now their letters
betrayed hints and more than hints of increasing anxiety.
The men wrote tentatively; but Frank Olliver, nothing if not
direct, poured forth her loving, unreasoning Irish heart on
closely-written sheets of foreign paper, to Wyndham's
alternate distraction and delight.</p>

<p>"Is there no manner of wild tale you could invent now to
rouse the blessed man?" she wrote about this time. "Sure
it's past believing that his pretty doll of a wife&mdash;who went
near to ruin him living&mdash;should stand between him and us
that love him, worse than ever now she's dead. The fear of
it haunts me like a bogey and makes me go red hot inside."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>
<p>The selfsame fear made Paul Wyndham go cold in the small
hours; but he could not bring himself to write of it, even
to Frank.</p>

<p>At last, in the second week of the New Year, there came news
that wrought a change in Desmond; news from John Meredith of
his father's broken health and his sister's immediate
departure for England. She would sail in a week, he wrote,
and would travel overland.</p>

<p>Paul, reading the letter to his friend, had a sudden
inspiration.</p>

<p>"Theo, let's go and meet her at Marseilles!" he said
eagerly, "and see her safe into the express. It would please
Meredith&mdash;and her too."</p>

<p>For the fraction of a second, an answering eagerness glowed
in Desmond's eyes; then vanished, leaving his face a
politely interested mask. But Paul had seen the flash and
pressed his point accordingly.</p>

<p>"Of <i>course</i> you'll come, Theo. A sight of her will do us
both good. I'm glad I thought of it."</p>

<p>"So am I," Desmond agreed, without a particle of gladness in
his level tone. "But&mdash;you can leave me out of the programme.
One of us is enough&mdash;for all that is needed; and it's only
right it should be you."</p>

<p>"I don't quite follow the logic of that."</p>

<p>Desmond's set face softened to a smile. "Don't you, old man?
Then you must take my word for it."</p>

<p>In spite of that smile Paul heard the note of finality in
his friend's voice and said no more.</p>

<p>On the appointed morning he set out alone to meet the ship,
pain and elation contending in his heart. But when, at last,
he set eyes on Honor Meredith, and saw her whole face
lighten at sight of him, complexities were submerged in a
flood-tide of simple, human joy.</p>

<p>But the exalted moment was short-lived. He could not fail to
see how, instinctively, her glance travelled beyond him; how
her lower lip was indrawn for the space of a heart-beat; and
when their hands met, he, as instinctively, answered her
thought.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>
<p>"I couldn't persuade Theo to come. He is still difficult to
rouse or move. The news of your father did seem to stir him
and I am hoping he will write."</p>

<p>She let out her breath unsteadily. "Oh, if he only would!
This interminable silence seems&mdash;so inhuman. In a way, I
understand it; but the others, out there, are getting
terribly unhappy over it; John and Frank more than all.
<i>You</i> don't think&mdash;do you&mdash;that there is really any
fear&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>The look in her eyes recalled that terrible night of March
when they two had watched over Theo in turn; and Paul knew
that now&mdash;as then&mdash;she craved no cheap consolation, but the
truth.</p>

<p>"There have been bad moments," he admitted, "when one was
afraid&mdash;&mdash;But now I honestly believe that he <i>will</i> fight
again and live again with his old zest; and I want you to
believe it too, with all your heart."</p>

<p>"I will believe it&mdash;with all my heart," she answered very
low and steadily. "Have you any plans&mdash;beyond Le Trayas?"</p>

<p>"Nothing definite. I just keep my eye on him and act
accordingly. In April, I think Bellagio would be a sound
move. There, if anywhere, the call of the spring should
prove irresistible. At least it's a prescription worth
trying."</p>

<p>She smiled; and, even in smiling, he noted the pathetic
droop of her eyelids and the corners of her lips.</p>

<p>"How wise you are for him, Paul! And you <i>will</i> come home
for a little before going back?"</p>

<p>"I hope so, devoutly, if Bellagio proves a success."</p>

<p>The crowd about them, surging chaotically to and fro,
recalled them to prosaic considerations of luggage and a
corner seat in the express, which Paul&mdash;unhurried yet
singularly efficient&mdash;did not fail to secure. That done,
Honor was confided to the care of an assiduous guard, and
was supplied with fruit, chocolate, and more newspapers than
she could possibly digest;&mdash;trifling services which the
girl, in her great loneliness, rated at their true value.</p>

<p>By that time the platform had emptied its contents into the
high, dingy-looking carriages of the Paris-Lyons Express. A
gong clanged. Honor put out an ungloved hand and had some
ado not to wince before it was released.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>
<p>"Thank you&mdash;for everything," she murmured, sudden tears
starting to her eyes. "I only wish Theo could have come
too!"</p>

<p>"I'll tell him that. It may do him good!"</p>

<p>In spite of herself the blood flew to her cheeks. But before
she could answer, the train jolted forward&mdash;and she was
gone.</p>

<p>Paul Wyndham stood a long while motionless, looking into
empty space; then, with a sensible jar, he came very
completely back to earth.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It was near sunset when he reached their haven of refuge, a
small hotel set in a rocky garden overlooking the sea. No
sign of Theo within doors,&mdash;and Paul strolled down the
narrow pathway that led to his friend's favourite seat.
There, at the far end, leaning upon the balustrade, he
sighted an unmistakable figure black against a blazing
heaven rippled with light clouds that gave promise of
greater glory to come.</p>

<p>Footsteps behind him roused Desmond. He started and turned
about with a new eagerness that was balm to the heart of his
friend.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;<i>there</i> you are! It's been a long day." His eyes
scanned Wyndham's face. "You've seen her?" he asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I have seen her."</p>

<p>"How did she look? Well?"</p>

<p>"She looked very beautiful," Paul answered simply, an odd
thrill in his voice. "But not&mdash;not like her old self. One
can see&mdash;she has suffered."</p>

<p>Desmond bit his lip and turned away again. A sudden mist
blurred the sunset splendour, the bronze and purple
iridescence of the sea. Paul went on speaking.</p>

<p>"She sent you a message, Theo&mdash;she wished you had come too."</p>

<p>"Did she? That was kind of her.&mdash;Sir John no worse?"</p>

<p>"Apparently not. She will write from Mavins."</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>He leaned on the balustrade as before and tacitly dismissed
the subject; but Wyndham, regarding him thoughtfully, and
remembering Honor's tell-tale blush, fell to dreaming of a
golden future for these two who were dearer to him than his
own soul.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>
<p>Suddenly Desmond spoke again in an altered tone.</p>

<p>"Paul&mdash;I've been thinking&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you, indeed! You do very little else these days.
What's the outcome?"</p>

<p>"Nothing brilliant. Quite the reverse. I'm a coward at
heart. That's all about it."</p>

<p>Paul smiled as a mother might smile at the vagaries of a
beloved child.</p>

<p>"Can't say I've seen any symptoms of the disease myself."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you're going to, old man, plain as daylight. It's
like this&mdash;&mdash;" he squared his shoulders with a jerk and
thrust both hands into his pockets. "I can't face&mdash;going
back to Kohat. I've suspected it for some time. Now I know
it. There's too much&mdash;that is to say&mdash;there <i>are</i> reasons.
Pretty big ones. But they don't bear talking of. Think me a
broken-backed cornstalk if you must. It'll hurt. But it
can't be helped."</p>

<p>For an instant Paul's heart stood still. Then: "Don't talk
that brand of nonsense to me, old man," he said gently. "But
if you really can't go back&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>"I said&mdash;to Kohat. The reliefs will take us to Dera in the
autumn. Well&mdash;I want to work another six months on urgent
private affairs&mdash;&mdash;" he tried to smile. "Do you think the
Colonel will come within a hundred miles of understanding
and be persuaded to back me up?"</p>

<p>"I think, just at present, he would be loth to refuse you
anything, Theo. But still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;<i>what?</i>"</p>

<p>His tone had a touch of defiance, almost of temper, purely
refreshing to hear.</p>

<p>"Well, naturally&mdash;I was thinking of the Regiment&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Damn the Regiment!" Desmond flashed out, and turning on his
heel strode off toward a wooded headland, whose red rocks
took an almost unearthly glow from the setting sun.</p>

<p>For several seconds Paul looked after him, scarcely able to
believe his ears. If Theo had arrived at damning the
Regiment, Frank's fear might not prove to be chimerical
after all; and yet the flash of temper, the renewed energy
of speech and movement were symptoms of the best.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>
<p>Paul sat down on the bench, folded his arms, and proceeded
to consider, in practical fashion, how they could secure the
desired extension of leave. Theo might dub himself coward if
he would. Paul knew better. He had long ago guessed that
stronger forces were at work in his friend than mere sorrow
for the loss of a wife, however dear&mdash;and he had guessed
right. It was Desmond's sensitive conscience that had been
his arch tormentor throughout those months of silence and
strangeness that had brought him near to madness and Paul
near to despair.</p>

<p>Tragedy on tragedy&mdash;loss of the Boy, dread of blindness, the
shock of his own discovery of Evelyn's defection, and the
awful fashion of her death&mdash;had so unsteadied and
overwrought his strong brain that, even now, he could
neither see nor think clearly in respect of those most
terrible weeks of his life. Obsessed by an exaggerated sense
of his own disloyalty to the wife who should never have been
transplanted to such stony soil, he saw himself virtually
her murderer, in the eyes of that God who was, for him, no
vague abstraction but the most commanding reality of his
consciousness.</p>

<p>Day after day, week after week, he had lived over and over
again the events of that fateful month, from the moment of
his return, to the last bewildering, unforgettable scene
with his wife. Always he discovered fresh excuses for her.
Always he lashed himself unsparingly for his own
failings;&mdash;the initial folly of bringing her to the
Frontier, his promise to Honor that had delayed his
determination to exchange, and more than all, that final
straight speaking&mdash;wrung from him by pain and shame&mdash;that
had made fear of him outweigh even her childish terror of
the dark. In the hidden depth of his heart he had been
untrue to her, and his passionate attempt at reparation had
come too late. There had even been fevered moments when he
told himself that he, Theo Desmond, not the crazy fanatic in
quest of sainthood&mdash;should by rights have been hanged and
burned on the day of her death.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>
<p>The whole tragical tangle, blurred and distorted by
incessant repetition, had come at last to seem almost a
separate entity; a horror, outside his own control, that now
shrank to a pin-point and now loomed gigantic, oppressive,
till all true sense of proportion was lost. The silence that
he could not force himself to break, infallibly made matters
worse. And now came Honor, re-awakening the great love he
had wrestled with and trampled on to very small purpose; a
love beside which his chivalrous tenderness for Evelyn
showed like the flame of a candle in the blaze of noon.</p>

<p>Her sudden return, the perturbing sense of her nearness, had
for the first time wrenched him away from the obsession of
the past. But even now he dared not frankly face the future;
dared not let his mind dwell on the colourless emptiness of
life without her. Neither could he, as yet, face the only
alternative&mdash;to tell her, of all women, that he had loved
her before his wife's death. Besides, there was Paul, who
obviously cared, in his own repressed fashion, and who must
not be baulked of his chance.</p>

<p>Yet to-night, as he tramped the whole round of that rocky
headland&mdash;in the glow of a sky rippled by now with feathers
of flame&mdash;his blood was in a fever for sheer desire of her,
and he cursed the folly that had impelled him to refuse the
morning's golden opportunity.</p>

<p>Returning later, in a more chastened mood, he found Wyndham
sitting still as a statue, seemingly forgetful of his
existence; and of a sudden his heart contracted at thought
of his friend's inexhaustible patience, his unquestioning
acceptance of moods to which he did not hold the key.
Stepping lightly, Desmond came up behind him and laid both
hands on his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, old man. I didn't precisely mean all that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Wyndham scarcely started.</p>

<p>"I thought as much! Don't apologise!" he said, looking up
with his slow smile. "It was a pure pleasure to hear you
swear again!"</p>

<p>Desmond laughed abruptly. "You'll get more than enough of
that kind of pleasure if they refuse me my six months!&mdash;But
look here, I'm thinking I can't keep <i>you</i> away from them
any longer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>
<p>"My dear Theo," Paul interposed with gentle decision. "So
long as you stay&mdash;I stay. That goes without saying. Meredith
will fix it up for us&mdash;no fear. Come on now. It's time we
went indoors."</p>

<p>They sauntered back up the gravel path together without
further speech, yet with thoughts more closely linked than
either guessed; thoughts that flew instinctively as homing
doves to the one beloved woman&mdash;Honor Meredith.</p>

<h2>II.</h2>

<p>A late April evening on Lake Como:&mdash;for the initiated there
is magic in the very words; magic of light and warmth and
colour; glory of roses and wistaria, that everywhere renew
the youth of ancient ruins and walls and weave a spring
garment even for the sombre cypress who has none of his own.
Love-song of birds, laughter of men and women, the
passionate blue above, the sun-warmed cobblestones
underfoot&mdash;in these also there is magic, unseizable,
irresistible as the happiness of a child. There is nothing
great about Como, nothing in the measured beauty of her
encircling hills to uplift or strike awe into the soul of a
man. She is exquisite, finished; a garden enclosed, a garden
of enchantment that speaks straight to the heart; and the
banner over her is peace.</p>

<p>Here Paul Wyndham&mdash;with the instinctive understanding that
belongs to a great love&mdash;had chosen to round off the
wander-year devoted to his friend. Throughout that year he
had done all that one man may do for another in his dark
hour; and each week his conviction grew stronger that
Honor&mdash;and none but Honor&mdash;could do the rest. Let them only
meet again, in fresh surroundings, and Theo&mdash;already so very
much her friend&mdash;could not fail to come under her spell. His
present seeming disposition to avoid her Paul set down to
her intimate association with his wife. Six months'
extension of leave had been granted to both, and Paul looked
to a summer in England to establish what Italy had already
begun.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>
<p>Since that night at Le Trayas, when Theo had damned the
Regiment and confessed his dread of returning to Kohat, Paul
had begun to be aware of a change in his friend. Apathy had
given place to restlessness, to a craving for distraction
that neither Nature nor Art could satisfy. From place to
place he had shifted like a man pursued. He fled as an
animal flies from a gadfly securely fastened into his flesh.
Go where he would, the passionate voice of his own heart
spoke louder than books and pictures, mountains and the sea,
urging him always in the one direction that his will was set
to avoid.</p>

<p>Wyndham&mdash;aware of some inner struggle, while far from
suspecting its nature&mdash;reckoned it all to the good, since it
implied that the real man was astir at last. His suggestion
of the Hotel Serbelloni at Bellagio&mdash;diplomatically
broached&mdash;had been hailed almost with enthusiasm; and a
month of Italy's April at its radiant best had proven, past
question, the wisdom of the move.</p>

<p>In those four weeks they had explored the length and breadth
of the lake with the restless energy of their race; had
tramped the stony roads of North Italy and climbed every
height within reach.</p>

<p>Better than all, it was now Theo who planned their
expeditions, studied guide books and discussed local legends
with his very good friend the Head Waiter. Flashes of temper
had become more frequent. He could even be lured into
argument again and grow hot over a game of chess. Trivial
details&mdash;but for Wyndham each was a jewel beyond price. And
Desmond was writing again now; fitfully but spontaneously,
as of old. He had written to Sir John, and to the Colonel;
and there had been two thick envelopes addressed to Frank;
but never a one to Honor Meredith.</p>

<p>It had needed only this to fill Paul's cup of content; but
Desmond&mdash;though he talked more openly of other
matters&mdash;seldom mentioned the girl.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>
<p>As on his return from the Samana, so now, he had fought his
hidden fight and come off conqueror. All things conspired to
convince him that Paul was the man&mdash;the infinitely worthier
man&mdash;of her choice; and their steady correspondence seemed
proof conclusive. At that rate there was nothing for it but
to stand aside, leaving Paul to go in and win; only&mdash;he
could not bring himself to be present at the process.</p>

<p>So these two friends, united by one of the closest ties on
earth, lived and thought at cross purposes, for the simple
reason that even of so fine a quality as reserve it is
possible to have too much of a good thing.</p>

<p>And now an end of peaceful isolation. To-morrow they would
cross to Menaggio homeward bound; and on this their last
evening they climbed the cobblestoned, corkscrew of a path
that winds to the ruins of Torre di Vezio above Varenna. The
fine outlook from the summit was Desmond's favourite view of
the lake. He himself had planned the outing, and now strode
briskly ahead of his friend, with more of the old vigour and
elasticity in his bearing than Paul had yet seen. To-day,
too, for the first time, he had discarded the crepe band
from the sleeve of his grey flannel suit; a silent admission
that the spirit of resurrection had not called to him in
vain.</p>

<p>Paul, noting these significant trifles, decided that he
could have chosen no time more propitious for the thing he
had to say. That morning's post had brought a letter from
Sir John Meredith begging them both to come straight to his
country house in Surrey for a week. Paul saw that invitation
as Theo's God-given chance to discover the treasure that was
his for the asking; and all day he had patiently awaited the
given moment for speech. Now he recognised it, and did not
intend to let it slip through his fingers.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>
<p>The grey stone walls and towers of the Torre di Vezio stood
four-square and rugged in the last of the sun; their
battlements jewelled with fine mosaic work of lichens, their
feet in the young grass of April starred with cowslips and
late primroses. Near the old wooden door two cypresses stood
sentinel, and the gnarled olives in the foreground loomed
ancient and unresponsive as the walls themselves. The light
wind of the morning had dropped with the sun; and the lake,
far below them, showed delicately blurred mirages of
townlets, hills, and sky. Southward, toward Como and Lecco,
all was saturated in the magical blue atmosphere, the aura
of Italy. Northward, toward Gravedona, the lesser Alps
gloomed grey-violet under a mass of indigo cloud that
blotted out the snows.</p>

<p>Theo Desmond, standing very erect, with the sun in his eyes,
felt the peace and beauty of it all flow through his veins
like wine.</p>

<p>"It's good to be up here. Very good. Sit down, old man."</p>

<p>Paul obeyed. They settled themselves on a green ledge near a
bold outcrop of rock. Desmond, leaning forward, sunk his
chin on his hand and fell into one of his brooding silences
that had grown rarer of late.</p>

<p>So long it lasted that Paul began to fear he might lose the
given moment after all. Yet every line of his friend's face
and figure spelled peace; and he was loth to break the
silence. Taking the letter from his pocket he opened it with
ostentatious cracklings. He read it through twice, very
leisurely; and still Desmond sat motionless, absorbed in the
changing lights on the water and the hills. Then Paul gave
it up and spoke.</p>

<p>"Theo&mdash;I've had a letter from Sir John. They're delighted to
hear we're coming home."</p>

<p>Desmond started and frowned without changing his position.
Only his stillness took on a more rigid quality. It had been
natural; now it was forced.</p>

<p>"The old man going on well?" he asked, feeling that some
remark was expected of him.</p>

<p>"Yes. He's almost himself again. He and Lady Meredith want
us to go straight to Mavins for a week. What do you think?"</p>

<p>This time an answer was imperative; but it stuck in
Desmond's throat.</p>

<p>"Very good of them. All the same&mdash;I think not," he said
slowly; then made a clumsy attempt to modify the blank
refusal. "You see, though I've taken this extra leave, I
don't mean to spend it in loafing. We've had our fill of
that. As soon as I get to town, I shall start reading in
earnest for my promotion."</p>

<p>Paul, puzzled and dismayed as he was, could not lightly
relinquish his castle in the air.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>
<p>"I'm glad you feel up to work again, Theo," he said. "But a
week in the country wouldn't seriously delay matters; and,
in the circumstances, it seems ungracious to refuse. It
would cheer the old man up. And it goes without saying that
Honor would be glad to see us again."</p>

<p>The last appeal roused Desmond effectually. He jerked
himself upright and faced his friend; faced also the ordeal
of open speech after months of evasion.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes. You're always right, old man," he said, eyes and
voice superbly under control. "I'm a selfish brute to
monopolise you and&mdash;er&mdash;stand in your light. A sight of you
will do them all good; and <i>you'll</i> be glad to see&mdash;Honor
again. I used to wonder&mdash;long ago&mdash;what hindered you from
fixing things up&mdash;you two."</p>

<p>It was Paul's turn now to start and change colour.</p>

<p>"You wondered?" he echoed blankly; then his voice dropped a
tone. "Well, Theo, since you've touched on the subject, I'd
as soon you knew the truth. I&mdash;spoke to Honor last March,
while you were away; and&mdash;she refused."</p>

<p>"Refused&mdash;<i>you?</i>"</p>

<p>In that flash of amazement and sympathy with his friend's
pain, Desmond escaped, if only for a moment, from the
tyranny of his own tormented soul. His gaze travelled back
to the hills.</p>

<p>"I'd have given her credit for more perception," he said
quietly; and Paul, regarding him with a whimsical
tenderness: "Has love anything to do with that sort of
thing?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no. I'm a blatant fool. But still&mdash;a man like you&mdash;&mdash;!"
He broke off short, and there was a moment of strained
silence. But the real Desmond was awake at last, and he
forced himself to add: "Women change sometimes&mdash;once they
know. Have you never been tempted to try again?"</p>

<p>"No; and never shall be, for a very good reason. There's
some one in the way&mdash;some other man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Desmond drew in his breath sharply.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he muttered in a low dazed voice, as if
thinking aloud. "But where the deuce <i>is</i> he? Why hasn't he
come forward? He must be a rotten sort of chap&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>
<p>Paul caressed his moustache to hide a smile. "Not
necessarily Theo. I gather, from what she said that&mdash;there
were difficulties&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Difficulties&mdash;?" Again he broke off, stunned by the
coincidence, yet incapable of suspecting the truth. Then,
pulling himself together, his spoke in his natural voice:
"Well, anyway, Paul, <i>you'd</i> better accept Sir John's
invitation, since you can still manage to be friends with
her in spite of that infernal chap in the background."</p>

<p>This time Paul smiled outright; but Desmond saw nothing. His
chin sunk in his hand, he sat still as a rock, raging
inwardly&mdash;as he had not raged for a full year&mdash;at thought of
that same "infernal chap" whose difficulties might not be
permanent; who might even now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly he became aware that Paul was answering his last
remark.</p>

<p>"Yes, Theo, I can just manage it," he was saying in a voice
of grave tenderness. "It has not been easy; but the truth is
that&mdash;when it came to the wrench&mdash;I hadn't the courage to
let her go quite out of my life."</p>

<p>"You had not the <i>courage</i>!" Desmond flashed round on him, a
gleam of the old fire in his eyes. "It's like you to put it
that way, Paul. The real truth is that you had the courage
to put mere passion under your feet. <i>I</i> should feel rather,
in such a case, that she <i>must</i> go quite out of my life.
There's the root difference between us. I should not have
the courage to accept friendship when I wanted&mdash;the other
thing. But we're not discussing my affairs&mdash;" He dismissed
himself with a gesture. "The point is, you'll go to Mavins
and make my excuses to Sir John."</p>

<p>"Yes, if you really wish it, I'll go alone, a little later
on. Only&mdash;you must furnish me with something valid in the
way of excuse. You know, as well as I do, that <i>you</i> are
first favourite with the old man. But I take it for granted
you have some good reason at the back of your mind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>
<p>"You're right there. I have&mdash;the strongest reason on
earth." He paused and set his teeth, bracing himself to the
final effort of confession. "What's more&mdash;I unintentionally
stated it a minute ago, in plain terms." He faced Wyndham
squarely now and a dull flush mounted to his temples. "Since
the ice is broken at last, there can be nothing less than
absolute truth between us," he said simply; and there was no
more need for the clumsy machinery of speech.</p>

<p>Paul's eyes, that neither judged nor questioned, rested on
his friend like a benediction. In that moment he had his
reward for months of silent service, of patience strained
almost to breaking point, of anxiety that bordered on
despair.</p>

<p>Minute after minute they sat silent, while the splendour in
the west blazed and spread till it challenged the oncoming
shadow in the north; and the near hills grown magically
ethereal, stood in a shimmer of gold, like hills of dream.</p>

<p>Then Desmond spoke again very quietly, without looking
round.</p>

<p>"Now perhaps you better understand&mdash;this last year?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Theo, I do understand," Paul answered in the same
tone, and Desmond let out a great breath.</p>

<p>"God! The relief it is to feel square with you again!"</p>

<h2>III.</h2>

<p>In a third-floor sitting-room, facing east, breakfast was
laid for two. Every item of the meal bespoke furnished
apartments; and even the May sunshine, flooding the place,
failed to beautify the shabby carpet and furniture, the
inevitable oleographs and the family groups that shared the
mantelpiece with pipes, pouches, and a tin of tobacco. A
hanging bookcase held some military books, a couple of
novels, and a volume of Browning&mdash;the property of Paul.
After Bellagio&mdash;Piccadilly; and their year abroad
constrained them to economy at home.</p>

<p>Theo Desmond sauntering in, scanned every detail with
fastidious distaste. To-day, for the first time, a great
longing possessed him for the airy ramshackle bungalows of
the Frontier he loved, for the trumpet-call to "stables,"
for a sight of his squadron and the feel of a saddle between
his knees.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>
<p>His wandering gaze lighted on a letter near Paul's place.
The address was in Honor's handwriting. He stood a moment
regarding it, then turned sharply away and went over to the
window. There he remained, seemingly absorbed in the varied
traffic of Piccadilly, actually consumed by such jealousy as
he had never suffered while he imagined that her heart was
given to his friend.</p>

<p>For Paul's sake he could and would endure all things; but
this detestable unknown who had won her and could not claim
her was quite another affair. There could be no thought of
standing aside on his account. It was simply a question of
Honor herself. She was not the woman lightly to withdraw her
love, once given. And yet&mdash;in a year&mdash;who could tell? Love,
like the spirit, bloweth where it listeth; and Paul's
failure did not of necessity predicate his own. For all her
sudden bewildering reserves, she had drawn very near to him
in those last terrible weeks at Kohat; and now&mdash;now&mdash;if he
could believe there was the veriest ghost of a chance&mdash;!</p>

<p>The mere possibility set heart and blood in a tumult; a
tumult checked ruthlessly by the thought that if Honor
Meredith was not the woman to change lightly, still less was
she the woman to approach with that confession which, at all
hazards, he was bound to make. Speaking of it to Paul had
cost him such an effort as he ached to remember. Speaking of
it to her seemed a thing inconceivable. And yet&mdash;in that
case&mdash;what hope of escape from this unholy tangle, from this
fury of jealousy that had stabbed his manhood broad awake at
last?</p>

<p>In Italy he fondly believed that he had fought his fight and
conquered. Yet now, behold, it was all to do over again!</p>

<p>"Theo, my dear chap, there <i>is</i> such a thing as breakfast!"
Paul's voice brought him back to earth with a thud. "Will
you have a congealed rasher or a tepid egg&mdash;or both?"</p>

<p>"Neither, confound you!" Desmond answered, swinging round
with an abrupt laugh and strolling back to the table.</p>

<p>Inevitably he glanced at the perturbing envelope, open now
and propped against the milk-jug, and as inevitably Paul
answered his look.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>
<p>"Honor is in town for a few days," he said, putting the
letter near Theo's plate, "staying with Lady Meredith's
sister. She hopes I can go in and see her this morning. She
seems under the impression that you are too busy, just now,
to be included in any invitation."</p>

<p>Desmond buttered a leathery triangle of toast with elaborate
precision. "You may as well encourage that notion, old chap.
It simplifies things. You're going yourself, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Lucky devil!"</p>

<p>He scowled at the envelope by his plate and tacitly
dismissed the subject by an excursion into the <i>Morning
Post</i>.</p>

<p>They talked politics and theatres till the unappetising meal
was ended and Paul pocketed his treasure with a sigh. It was
the first time Theo had ignored one of her letters; and the
simple-hearted fellow&mdash;quite unaware that his mention of the
other man had been a master-stroke of policy&mdash;felt almost at
his wits' end. Standing by the mantelpiece mechanically
filling his pipe, he watched Desmond set out his books and
papers on the table near the window, intent on a morning of
abnormal industry; and the pathos of it all caught at his
heart. For the first time in his controlled and ordered life
he felt impelled to carry a situation by storm&mdash;the result
possibly of playing Providence to Theo for the space of a
year.</p>

<p>But Theo plus a woman, loving and beloved, whom he
obstinately refused to meet, was a problem demanding far
more of diplomacy, of intimate human experience than Paul
Wyndham had been blest withal. The one obvious service
required of him was easier to recognise than to achieve. By
some means these two must be brought together in spite of
themselves; but for all his forty years he was pathetically
at a loss to know how the deuce one contrived that sort of
thing. It was a woman's job. Mrs Olliver, now, could have
fixed it all up in a twinkling; while he&mdash;poor clumsy
fool!&mdash;could only sit there smoking and racking his brain,
while his eyes perfunctorily scanned the columns of the
<i>Morning Post</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></p>
<p>The doings of the world and the misdoings of those in
power, earthquakes, shipwrecks, and rumours of wars&mdash;all
these were as nothing to him compared with the insignificant
tangle of one man and one woman among the whole seething,
suffering throng. But concern brought him no nearer to the
unravelling of their tangle; and when the time came to go he
could think of nothing better than a direct appeal to his
friend.</p>

<p>Desmond still sat at the table, head in hand, absorbed in
the intricacies of military tactics.</p>

<p>Paul rose and went over to him. "I'm going now, old chap."
The matter of fact statement was made with indescribable
gentleness. "I'll be back in an hour or so. Wish to goodness
you were coming too."</p>

<p>"Damned if you can wish it more than I do," Desmond answered
without looking up.</p>

<p>"Well then&mdash;come. Is it really&mdash;so impossible as you think?"</p>

<p>Desmond nodded decisively. "Can't you see it for yourself,
man? Even if she <i>was</i> quit of that other confounded fellow,
how could I face telling her&mdash;the truth?"</p>

<p>For a moment Paul was silenced; not because he found the
question unanswerable, but because of that hidden knowledge
which he might not disclose, even to save his friend.</p>

<p>"My dear Theo," he said at last, "I know&mdash;and you
know&mdash;that, sooner than lose her, you could go through any
kind of fire. Besides, I have an idea she would
understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So have I," Desmond answered gruffly, "that's the deuce of
it all. But it doesn't make a man less unworthy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If it comes to that," urged the diplomatist, "are any of us
worthy?"</p>

<p>Desmond flung up his head with an odd laugh.</p>

<p>"Possibly not! But there happen to be degrees of
unfitness&mdash;yours and mine for instance, you blind old bat!
Go along now, and enjoy the good you deserve. As for me&mdash;I
have sinned and must take the consequences without whining."</p>

<p>"There is a radical difference, Theo," Paul remarked
quietly, "between temptation and sin."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>
<p>"Casuist!" was all the answer vouchsafed to him; and
baffled&mdash;but not yet defeated&mdash;he went out into the May
sunlight, quite determined, for once in his life, to take by
storm the citadel that seemed proof against capitulation.</p>

<p>Before reaching his destination he had devised a plan so
simple and obvious that it might have occurred to a child;
and like a child he gloried in his unaided achievement. The
fact that it involved leading them both blindfold to the
verge of mutual discovery troubled him not a whit. Heart and
conscience alike asserted that in this case the end
justified the means; and it needed but the veiled light in
Honor's eyes at mention of Theo's name to set the seal on
his decision.</p>

<p>For near an hour they talked, with that effortless ease and
intimacy which is the hail-mark of a genuine friendship; and
at the end of it Honor realised that, without any conscious
intention on her part, Theo&mdash;and little else but Theo&mdash;had
been their topic as a matter of course. Never dreaming of
design on the part of Paul, she merely blessed him for a
devotion that almost equalled her own, and accepted, with
unfeigned alacrity, his suggestion that they should meet
next morning at the Diploma Gallery.</p>

<p>"I've not been there for a hundred years!" she declared with
more of her old lightness than he had yet seen in her: "It
will take me back to bread-and-butter days! And I believe
they have added some really good pictures since then."</p>

<p>Paul exulted as an angler exults when he feels his first
salmon tug at the line; but his tone was casual and
composed. "Come early," he said. "Then we shall pretty well
have the place to ourselves. Eleven? Half-past?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere between the two."</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>And Paul Wyndham&mdash;the devout lover, who had trampled passion
underfoot to some purpose&mdash;walked back to Piccadilly like a
man reprieved. Honor was secure. Remained the capture of
Theo&mdash;a more difficult feat; but, in his present mood, he
refused to contemplate the possibility of failure.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>
<p>A morning of unclouded brilliance found Desmond frankly
bored with tactics and topography; the more so, perhaps,
because Paul with simple craft took his industry for
granted.</p>

<p>Soon after eleven, he put aside the inevitable pipe and
newspaper and took up his hat. "Well, Theo," said he, "you
won't be needing me till after lunch I suppose?&mdash;I'm off."</p>

<p>"Where to, old man?" Desmond yawned extensively as he spoke,
and pushed aside his little pile of red books with a
promising gesture of distaste. "What's your dissipated
programme?"</p>

<p>"An hour in the Diploma Gallery, and a stroll in the Park,"
Paul replied with admirable unconcern. "D'you feel like
coming?"</p>

<p>"I feel like chucking all these into the waste-paper basket!
When England takes it into her capricious head to do this
sort of thing in May, how the devil can a human man keep his
nose to the grindstone? Come on!"</p>

<p>Paul's heart beat fast as they stepped into the street;
faster still as he glanced at Theo striding briskly beside
him, head in air all unconscious that he was faring toward a
tryst far more in tune with the season and the new life
astir in his blood than his late abnormal zeal in pursuit of
promotion.</p>

<p>To Paul it seemed that the heavens themselves were in league
with him. Overhead, scattered ranks of chimneypots were
bitten out of a sky scarcely less blue and ardent than
Italy's own. In every open space young leaves flashed,
golden-green, on soot-blackened branches of chestnut, plane,
and lime. And there were flowers everywhere&mdash;in squares and
window-boxes and parks; in florists' and milliners' windows;
in the baskets of flower-sellers and in women's hats. The
paper-boy&mdash;blackbird of the London streets&mdash;whistled a
livelier stave. Girls hurried past smiling at nothing in
particular. They were glad to be alive&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>And Theo?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>
<p>He too was glad to be alive, to be free, at last, from the
conquering shadow of memory and self-reproach. If penance
were required of him, surely that black year must suffice.
Now the living claimed him; and that claim could no longer
be ignored. With a heart too full for speech he walked
beside his friend; and halting at last, on the steps of
Burlington House, he bared his head to the sunlight and drew
a deep breath of content.</p>

<p>"I vote we don't waste much of this divine morning on
pictures, Paul," he said suddenly. "Why bother about them at
all?"</p>

<p>Wyndham started visibly; but in less than a minute he was
master of himself and the situation.</p>

<p>"Well, as we're here, we may as well look in," he answered
casually; and without waiting further objection, turned to
enter the building.</p>

<p>Desmond, following, laid a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Anything to please you, old man," said he smiling.</p>

<p>"God knows you've danced attendance on <i>my</i> whims long
enough!"</p>

<p>No sign of Honor in the cloistered coolness of the first
room; only a small group of people in earnest talk before
one of the pictures, and an artist, with stool and easel,
making a conscientious copy of another.</p>

<p>Desmond made a cursory tour of the walls and passed on into
the second room. Paul, increasingly anxious every moment,
lagged behind and consulted his watch. It was twenty-five
minutes past eleven. Would she never come?</p>

<p>The second room was empty, and there Desmond's aimless
wandering had been checked by a battle picture; a vigorous
and tragic presentment of Sir John Moore's retreat from
Corunna.</p>

<p>"Here you are, Paul. Here's something worth looking at,"
said he as Wyndham joined him; and, soldier-like, they soon
fell to discussing the event rather than the picture.
Desmond&mdash;his head full of tactics and military history&mdash;held
forth fluently quite in his old vein; while Paul&mdash;who heard
scarce one word in six&mdash;nodded sagely at appropriate
intervals.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>
<p>Hope died hard in him. A clock outside, chiming the
half-hour, rang its knell with derisive strokes that seemed
to beat upon his heart. It was just his luck. She would
never turn up. A hundred contingencies might arise to
prevent her&mdash;a street accident, a headache, bad news of her
father&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Sudden silence from Theo cut short the dismal list; and one
glance at him told Paul that his hour was come indeed. For
Desmond stood rigid, a dull flush burning through his tan;
and his eyes looked over Paul's shoulder towards the
entrance into Room Number One.</p>

<p>"My God!" he muttered hoarsely, "Here's Honor!"</p>

<p>Without a word Paul turned on his heel and saw how she, too,
stood spellbound, there by the doorway, her cheeks aflame,
her eyes more eloquent than she knew. Taken completely
unawares, each had surprised the other's secret, even as
Paul had foreseen. In that lightning flash of mutual
recognition, the end he had wrought for, and agonised for,
was achieved. Obviously they had no further need of his
services&mdash;and, unnoticed by either, he passed quietly out of
the room.</p>

<p>For one measureless minute they remained confronting each
other; scarcely daring to breathe lest they break the spell
of that passionate unspoken avowal. Then Honor came forward
slowly, like one walking in her sleep&mdash;and the spell was
gone. In two strides Desmond had reached her and grasped her
outstretched hand.</p>

<p>No attempt at conventional futilities marred their supreme
moment. Words seemed an impertinence in view of the
overwhelming fact that he stood before her thus&mdash;his face
transfigured and illumined by love unutterable, by a
discovery scarcely realised even now.</p>

<p>There was so much to tell, and again, so little after all,
that there seemed no need to tell it. Yet Honor could not
choose but long for the sound of his voice; and to that end
she tried very gently to withdraw her hand.</p>

<p>Desmond&mdash;suddenly aware that they were alone&mdash;tightened his
grasp. "No&mdash;no," he protested under his breath, "unless&mdash;you
wish it. <i>Do</i> you&mdash;Honor?"</p>

<p>"I don't wish it," she answered very low, and her eyes,
resting on his, had a subdued radiance as of sunlight seen
through mist.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>
<p>Haloed in that radiance Desmond beheld the "infernal chap"
he had been cursing for weeks; realised instantaneously all
that the recognition implied; and, capturing both her hands,
crushed them between his own.</p>

<p>"Honor&mdash;my splendid Honor!"</p>

<p>He still spoke under his breath; and still his eyes held
hers in a gaze so compelling that it seemed as though he
were drawing her very soul into his own with a force that
she had neither will nor power to resist.</p>

<p>In that long look she knew that, for all her passionate
intensity of heart and spirit, this man, whom she had won,
surpassed her in both; that in all things he rose above
her&mdash;and would always rise. And because she was very woman
at the core, such knowledge gladdened her beyond telling;
crowned her devotion as wedded love is rarely crowned in a
world honeycombed with half-heartedness in purpose and faith
and love.</p>
